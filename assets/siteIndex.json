"text": "Appendix B: Guidelines for Court Dispute Resolution for Non-Injury Motor Accident Claims and Personal Injury Claims 1. Introduction 1.1 The State Courts’ Court Dispute Resolution Cluster (CDRC) provides Court Dispute Resolution (CDR) services for all civil matters. Two main processes – mediation and neutral evaluation – are used. 1.2 According to Practice Directions 37 and 38, all non-injury motor accident claims and personal injury claims are to proceed for CDR within 8 weeks after the Memorandum of Appearance has been filed. 1.3 Neutral evaluation will be used in the CDR sessions for these cases. This Appendix sets out the guidelines to be followed by solicitors. 2. Application 2.1 The guidelines in this Appendix shall apply to all writs for non-injury motor accident and personal injury claims that are filed in Court on or after 1st April 2016 and to all motor accident cases (whether or not involving any claim for personal injuries) and actions for personal injuries arising out of an industrial accident that are commenced in the High Court on or after 1st December 2016 and transferred to the District Court. 3. Date of CDR 3.1 As stated in Practice Directions 37(2) and 38(2), solicitors in these cases will receive a notice from the Court fixing the first CDR session. 3.2 A request for an adjournment of a CDR session shall be made only by filing a “Request for Refixing/Vacation of Hearing Dates” via the Electronic Filing Service. 3.3 The applicant must obtain the consent of the other parties to the adjournment, and list the dates that are unsuitable for all the parties. 3.4 The request must be made not less than 2 working days before the date of the CDR. 3.5 An adjournment of a CDR session will be granted only for good reason e.g. the solicitor is engaged in a trial or other hearing in the High Court or the State Courts, is away on in-camp training, is overseas, or on medical leave; or the party or his witness, if asked to attend, is out of the country or otherwise unavailable for good reason. 3.6 A CDR session from which one or all parties are absent without good reason will be counted as one CDR session. 4. Attendance at CDR 4.1 Only solicitors are required to attend CDR sessions. Their clients need not be present unless the Judge directs their attendance. 4.2 In certain cases, the Judge may direct the parties to attend subsequent CDR sessions. For instance, the drivers of the vehicles involved in a motor accident and eyewitnesses may be asked to be present at a later CDR session for the purpose of a more accurate neutral evaluation or to facilitate in negotiating a settlement. 5. Preparation for CDR 5.1 In all non-injury motor accident and personal injury claims, solicitors should exchange before the first CDR session, a list of all the relevant documents relating to both liability and quantum. 5.2 In addition, solicitors should exchange the following documents before the first CDR session: 5.2.1 For CDRs for motor accident claims - (a) Full and complete Singapore Accident Statements and police reports including the names, identity card numbers and addresses of all persons involved in the accident, together with type-written transcripts of their factual accounts of the accident; (b) Police sketch plan and if unavailable, the parties’ sketches of the accident; (c) Results of police investigations or outcome of prosecution for traffic offence(s); (d) Police vehicle damage reports; (e) Original, coloured copies or scanned photographs of damage to all vehicles; (f) Original, coloured copies or scanned photographs of the accident scene; (g) Video recording of the accident (if any); (h) Accident reconstruction report (if any); (i) Names and addresses of witnesses (if any); (j) Repairer’s bill and evidence of payment; (k) Surveyor’s report; (l) Excess bill or receipt; (m) Vehicle registration card; (n) COE/PARF certificates; (o) Rental agreement, invoice and receipt for rental of replacement vehicle (if any); (p) Correspondences with the defendant’s insurer relating to pre-repair survey and/or post-repair inspection of the plaintiff’s vehicle; (q) Any other supporting documents. 5.2.2 For CDRs for personal injury claims or where personal injury forms part of the motor accident claim - (a) Medical reports from the treating doctor, reviewing doctor and medical specialist; (b) Certificates for hospitalisation and medical leave; (c) Bills for medical treatment and evidence of payment; (d) Income tax notices of assessment and/or other evidence of income and loss thereof; (e) Supporting documents for all other expenses claimed (if any). 5.2.3 For CDRs for industrial accidents - (a) The parties’ sketches of the accident; (b) Notice of accident lodged with the Ministry of Manpower; (c) Ministry of Manpower’s investigation reports (if any); (d) Notice of Assessment from the Occupational Safety and Health Division, Ministry of Manpower (if any); (e) Outcome of prosecution (if any); (f) Original, coloured copies or scanned photographs of the accident scene; (g) Video recording of the accident (if any); (h) Names and addresses of witnesses (if any); (i) Any other supporting documents. 5.2.4 For CDRs for any personal injury claim not involving motor accidents or industrial accidents - (a) The parties’ sketches of the accident; (b) Original, coloured copies or scanned photographs of the accident scene; (c) Video recording of the accident (if any); (d) Names and addresses of witnesses (if any); (e) Any other supporting documents. 5.3 Documents and instructions 5.3.1 Solicitors shall endeavour to obtain from their clients all documents in good time for exchange between the parties before the first CDR session. They should also check that all documents needed for consideration of the claim are ready. If any additional documents apart from those referred to in paragraph 5.2 are required, this shall be made known to the other party well before the CDR date. If a re-inspection of the other party’s vehicle is required, it shall be conducted and the report exchanged before the first CDR session. 5.3.2 It is very important that solicitors take full and complete instructions from their respective clients before attending the CDR session. Before the CDR session, solicitors should evaluate with their clients the documents and reports and advise their clients on all the relevant aspects of their case. 5.3.3 Where a party is relying on the factual account of any witness in support of his case, a signed statement or Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief should be procured from that witness and submitted to the Court at the first CDR session to enable the Court to be fully apprised of all the relevant evidence. 5.3.4 Insurers should notify their solicitors if, to their knowledge, other claims arising from the same accident have been filed in Court. Solicitors should assist the Court in identifying these related claims so that all the claims may be dealt with together at CDR sessions for a consistent outcome on liability. If an indication on liability has been given or interlocutory judgment has been entered in any related claim(s), solicitors should notify the Court accordingly and endeavour to resolve the remaining claims(s) on the same basis. 5.3.5 Third party proceedings, if any, should be commenced before the first CDR session. 5.4 To make the full use of CDR sessions, it is essential that solicitors be well prepared and familiar with their cases. This also applies to duty solicitors assigned by their firms to deal with the firm’s cases on a particular day. Duty solicitors must receive their files in good time and with clear instructions from the solicitor in charge so that they can familiarise themselves with the cases, understand the basis of instructions (i.e. why a certain position is taken) and to act on them (e.g. to convey the clients’ offer on quantum or liability to the opposing solicitor). Duty solicitors must, after the CDR session, ensure that they convey to the solicitor in charge, the rationale for the Judge’s indication, the discussion at CDR sessions, and the follow-up action to be taken before the date of the next CDR session. 6. CDR Session Claims subject to the simplified process under Order 108 of the Rules of Court 6.1 All cases commenced by writ on or after 1st November 2014 in a Magistrate’s Court and any case commenced by writ on or after 1st November 2014 in a District Court (where parties have filed their consent in Form 233 of Appendix A of the Rules of Court for Order 108 to apply) will be subject to the simplified process under Order 108 of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5). 6.2 The requirement for upfront discovery under Order 108 Rule 2(4) of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5) and Practice Direction 19 (Upfront discovery) apply to such cases. 6.3 These claims will continue to be called for CDR within 8 weeks after the filing of the memorandum of appearance. There will be no case management conference convened. The rest of the guidelines in Appendix B also apply to CDRs for these claims. 6.4 Where parties are unable to resolve the case through CDR, the Court will manage the case, having regard to the provisions in Order 108 Rule 5 of the Rules of Court, by, inter alia, — (a) giving such directions as the Court thinks fit in order to ensure that the case progresses expeditiously (including directions for the list of witnesses to be called for trial, the appointment of a single joint expert where appropriate, the exchange and filing of Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief and setting the matter down for trial); (b) fixing timelines to manage and control the progress of the case; and (c) taking such other action or making such other direction as the Court thinks appropriate in the circumstances including costs sanctions or unless orders. 6.5 Where any question requiring the evidence of an expert witness arises and parties are unable to agree on the expert to be appointed, the Court may, having regard to the provisions in Order 108, Rule 5(3) of the Rules of Court, appoint the expert for the parties at a CDR session. Each party is expected to furnish the following for the determination of the single joint expert: (a) names and curriculum vitae of two experts the party considers suitable to appoint (for which purpose a party may nominate the expert who has conducted an inspection, survey or review for him or provided him with medical treatment); (b) the fees charged by each nominated expert for preparing the report and attendance in Court; (c) the estimated time needed to prepare the report; and (d) whether the parties have complied with the pre-action protocol. The Court will appoint the single joint expert after hearing submissions on the suitability or unsuitability of the nominated experts to be appointed. Indications on liability and quantum 6.6 For NIMA and PIMA cases, the Court will provide an indication on liability if — (a) the factual matrix of the particular motor accident does not correspond substantially with any of the scenarios set out in the Motor Accident Guide (1st Edn., 2014 State Courts, Singapore) (“Motor Accident Guide”) ; or (b) despite the parties’ reasonable efforts in resolving the question of liability through negotiation with reference to the Motor Accident Guide before the CDR session, no settlement has been reached. 6.7 Solicitors for all the parties seeking an indication on liability in NIMA and PIMA cases must submit a duly completed “Liability Indication Form (NIMA and PIMA Claims)” (see Form 9A) to the Court at the first CDR session. Except in cases where no corresponding scenario is provided for in the Motor Accident Guide, solicitors must specify in the Liability Indication Form the scenario(s) in the Motor Accident Guide that is/are relevant to the parties’ factual accounts of the accident and state their respective proposals on liability. 6.8 Solicitors for all parties seeking an indication on liability in industrial accident cases must submit a duly completed “Liability Indication Form (Industrial Accident Claims)” (see Form 9A(A)) to the Court at the first CDR session. 6.9 In CDR sessions for all personal injury claims, except PIMA claims, the Court will provide an indication on both liability and quantum of the claim. Solicitors for all the parties shall submit a duly completed “Quantum Indication Form” (see Form 9B) to the Court at the first CDR session. 6.10 In respect of PIMA cases, whether or not an indication on liability is given, the Court may, at its own discretion in appropriate cases or at solicitors’ request, provide an indication on quantum. Solicitors requesting for an indication on quantum must obtain each other’s consent before the CDR session, and submit the duly completed Quantum Indication Form (i.e. Form 9B) to the Court. 7. Help and Co-operation of Insurers in facilitating CDR 7.1 Insurers play a key role in the success of CDR. CDR sessions are intended for substantive discussion of the issues. A CDR is unproductive if: 7.1.1 parties have not — (a) exchanged the relevant documents listed in paragraph 5; or (b) identified the scenario(s) in the Motor Accident Guide that is/are relevant to their respective factual accounts of the accident well before the CDR session to facilitate assessment and discussion of options; 7.1.2 one or more of the solicitors for the parties have not received or are still taking client’s instructions; or 7.1.3 parties are still negotiating or are awaiting instructions upon a counter-offer. 8. Follow up action after CDR 8.1 Solicitors must inform their clients of the outcome of a CDR session and render their advice quickly on the liability and/or quantum indications given by the Court. To facilitate settlement, solicitors should obtain their clients’ instructions and make the necessary proposals or offers of settlement early to enable the other party to consider their position or proposal and respond before the next CDR date. Reasons shall be given for the position taken on liability and/or quantum so that the solicitors can inform the Court of the basis for their clients’ mandate at the next CDR session. 8.2 Rather than refraining from taking a position on liability or insisting that agreement on liability is contingent on quantum being settled at a particular sum (as is sometimes the case), parties who are able to agree on the issue of liability but not quantum shall consider allowing an Interlocutory Judgment to be recorded for liability and proceed for assessment of damages. A hearing to assess damages is far less costly than a full trial.

"text": "Appendix C: Pre-action Protocol for Non-Injury Motor Accident Cases 1. Application 1.1 The object of this protocol is to prescribe reasonable conduct for non-injury motor accident claims. It prescribes a framework for pre-writ negotiation and exchange of information. In exercising its discretion and powers, the court will have regard to compliance with this protocol or lack thereof; see, for example, Order 25, Rules 1, 1A and 8, Order 34A, Rule 1, Order 59, Rule 5, and Order 59 Appendix 2, of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5). 1.2 This protocol applies to actions arising out of non-injury motor accidents occurring on or after — (a) 1st April 2016 that are to be lodged with the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre Ltd (“FIDReC”) or to be filed in in the Magistrate’s Court or the District Court, as the case may be; and (b) 1st December 2016 that are to be filed in the High Court (and subsequently transferred to the District Court). This protocol governs pre-action conduct and sets out best practices in respect of such claims. 1.3 Any reference to “the potential defendant” in this protocol refers to the potential defendant if he is not claiming under his insurance policy, or to his insurer if he is claiming under his policy. 1.4 Any reference to an “insurer” in this protocol refers to an insurer that is known or could be reasonably known to the claimant. 1.5 This protocol does not affect any privilege that may apply to any communication between the parties that is undertaken in compliance with it. 1.6 The Court will not impose sanctions where there are good reasons for non-compliance with the provisions of this protocol. 2. Notice of Accident and Pre-repair Survey 2.1 Time is of the essence in the joint selection of a motor surveyor and the conduct of a pre-repair survey of the claimant’s vehicle. 2.2 Within 3 working days of the date of the accident, the claimant must send a notice of accident (Form 1 in this protocol) to the potential defendant and his insurer (or where there is a multi-party collision, to each of the potential defendants and his insurer). This is to facilitate a joint survey of the damage to the claimant’s vehicle prior to the commencement of repairs (“pre-repair survey”). The pre-repair survey will include a survey of the vehicle when its damaged parts are being dismantled prior to the commencement of repairs. 2.3 Within 2 working days of receipt of the notice of accident, the insurer must reply to the claimant (Form 2 in this protocol) and if he intends to conduct a pre-repair survey of the claimant’s damaged vehicle, he must include in his reply a list of at least 10 motor surveyors. 2.4 Within 2 working days of receipt of the insurer’s reply, the claimant must reply to the insurer stating whether he agrees or has any objections to the appointment of any of the motor surveyors proposed by the insurer. The claimant may specifically select one or more of the proposed motor surveyors. If the claimant fails to reply or fails in his reply to object to any of the motor surveyors listed by the insurer within the time stipulated by this paragraph, the claimant is deemed to have agreed to the appointment of any of the motor surveyors listed by the insurer. 2.5 The motor surveyor mutually agreed upon by the parties or presumed to be agreed by the claimant shall be referred to as the “single joint expert”. Upon reaching such agreement or upon the expiry of the time stipulated for the claimant to object to the motor surveyors proposed by the insurer and the claimant fails to do so (as the case may be), the insurer must immediately instruct the single joint expert to conduct the pre-repair survey. The single joint expert must complete the pre-repair survey within 2 working days of his appointment. 2.6 If the claimant objects to all the motor surveyors proposed by the insurer, he must include in his reply a list of at least 10 motor surveyors whom he considers as suitable to appoint. 2.7 Within 2 working days of receipt of the claimant’s list of proposed motor surveyors, the insurer must state whether he agrees or has any objections to any of the motor surveyors proposed by the claimant. The insurer may specifically select one or more of the proposed motor surveyors. If the insurer fails to reply or fails in his reply to object to any of the motor surveyors listed by the claimant within the time stipulated by this paragraph, the insurer is deemed to have agreed to the appointment of any of the motor surveyors listed by the claimant. 2.8 The motor surveyor mutually agreed upon by both parties or presumed to be agreed by the insurer shall be referred to as the “single joint expert”. Upon reaching such agreement, the insurer must immediately instruct the single joint expert to conduct the pre-repair survey. Alternatively, upon the expiry of the time stipulated for the insurer to object to the motor surveyors proposed by the claimant and the insurer fails to do so, the claimant must immediately instruct the single joint expert to conduct the pre-repair survey. The single joint expert instructed by the insurer or the claimant (as the case may be) must complete the pre-repair survey within 2 working days of his appointment. 2.9 If the insurer objects to all the motor surveyors proposed by the claimant, both parties are not precluded from instructing a motor surveyor of their own choice to conduct the pre-repair survey. In such event, the motor surveyor appointed by the insurer must complete the pre-repair survey for the insurer within 2 working days from the date of the insurer’s reply objecting to all the motor surveyors proposed by the claimant. If the quantum of the potential claim is likely to be within the Magistrate’s Court limit, parties are to be aware of Order 108, Rule 5(3) of the Rules of Court on the appointment of a single joint expert should the matter be unresolved subsequently and proceed for a simplified trial. Both parties shall in any event not unreasonably withhold consent to the appointment of a single joint expert as far as possible. 2.10 Once the pre-repair survey has been conducted, the claimant and the insurer shall negotiate and, as far as possible, come to an agreement on the cost of repairing the claimant’s vehicle.  2.11 If parties are unable to come to an agreement on the cost of repairing the vehicle after negotiations, the claimant may proceed to repair his vehicle. The insurer may wish to request for an opportunity to conduct a post repair inspection once the vehicle has been repaired. The request should be made as soon as possible and before the repaired vehicle is returned to the claimant. 3. Letter of Claim 3.1 The claimant must send a letter of claim (Form 3 in this protocol) to every potential defendant and his insurer. The letter of claim must set out the full particulars of his claim and enclose a list of all the relevant documents relating to both liability and quantum. The claimant must also include in his letter of claim a copy each of all relevant supporting documents, where available, such as: (a) full and complete Singapore Accident Statements together with type-written transcripts of all persons involved in the accident, including a sketch plan; (b) repairer’s bill and evidence of payment; (c) motor surveyor’s report; (d) excess bill/receipt; (e) vehicle registration card; (f) COE/PARF certificates; (g) names of all witnesses (where possible to disclose); (h) original, coloured copies or scanned photographs of damage to all vehicles; (i) original, coloured copies or scanned photographs of the accident scene; (j) video recording of the accident (if any); (k) accident reconstruction report (if any); (l) rental agreement, invoice and receipt for rental of replacement vehicle (if any); (m) correspondences with the potential defendant’s insurer relating to pre-repair survey and/or post repair inspection of the claimant’s vehicle; (n) any other supporting documents. 3.2 The claimant must also state in his letter of claim whether he had notified the insurer of the accident by sending the notice of accident. If a pre-repair survey was conducted and the claim for cost of repairs is made pursuant to the amount negotiated and agreed upon by the parties, this should be stated in the letter of claim. 3.3 If, to the claimant’s knowledge, the insurer had waived the requirement for pre-repair survey and/or post-repair inspection of the vehicle, he should state so accordingly in the letter of claim. 3.4 The letter of claim must also instruct the potential defendant to immediately pass the letter and documents to his insurer if he wishes to claim under his insurance policy. The letters to any other potential defendants must be copied to the rest of the parties. The letter(s) to the potential defendant(s) must be sent by e-mail, fax or certificate of posting. The letters to insurers must be sent by e-mail, fax, A.R. Registered mail or by hand (in which case an acknowledgement of receipt should be obtained). 4. Potential Defendant’s response 4.1 If the insurer wishes to conduct a post-repair inspection of the claimant’s vehicle not conducted previously, he must make the request to the claimant within 7 days of receipt of the letter of claim. The insurer must state in the letter of request why a post-repair inspection is now sought, especially if the opportunity for pre-repair survey and/or post-repair inspection had earlier been waived. 4.2 The claimant must reply within 7 days of receipt of the letter of request. Where valid reasons are given by the insurer, the parties shall as far as possible, agree on the arrangements for the post-repair inspection so as to facilitate an amicable resolution of the claim as soon as possible. 4.3 The potential defendant must send an acknowledgement letter (Form 4 or Form 4A in this protocol) to the claimant within 14 days of receipt of the letter of claim. If he is ready to take a position on the claim, he must state his position. If not, he must first send an acknowledgement. 4.4 If the claimant does not receive an acknowledgement letter within the requisite 14 days, the claimant may commence proceedings without any sanction by the Court. 4.5 If the potential defendant replies to the claimant with only an acknowledgement, within 8 weeks from the date of receipt of the letter of claim or within 14 days after inspecting the vehicle, whichever is later, the potential defendant must reply to the claimant substantively, stating the potential defendant’s position on the claim as to both liability and quantum, for example whether the claim is admitted or denied or making an offer of settlement (Form 4 or Form 4A in this protocol). 4.6 If the claim is not admitted in full, the potential defendant must: (a) give reasons and provide the claimant with a list setting out all the relevant documents; (b) include in his reply a copy of each of all relevant supporting documents; (c) confirm/state the identity of the person driving his vehicle at the time of the accident and provide the driver’s identification number and address if this is not already stated in the Singapore Accident Statement; (d) enclose full and complete Singapore Accident Statements showing the names, identification numbers and addresses of all other persons involved in the accident and typewritten transcripts of their factual accounts of the accident; (e) enclose any pre-repair and/or post-repair survey/inspection report(s); and (f) specify the particular scenario in the Motor Accident Guide that is applicable to his account of the accident, enclose with his reply a copy of the relevant page of the Motor Accident Guide, and, except where the claim is denied, make an offer on liability (Form 4A in this protocol). 4.7 If the insurer is the party replying to the claimant, the reply shall also state the name(s), telephone number(s) and fax number(s) of the insurance officer(s) handling the matter and the insurer’s file reference number(s), to facilitate correspondence. 4.8 If the potential defendant has a counterclaim, he must include it in his reply giving full particulars of the counterclaim together with all relevant supporting documents. If the potential defendant is pursuing his counterclaim separately, i.e. his insurer is only handling his defence but not his counterclaim, the potential defendant must send a letter to the claimant giving full particulars of the counterclaim together with all relevant supporting documents within 8 weeks from receipt of the letter of claim. If the potential defendant has already furnished particulars in a separate letter of claim, he need only refer to that letter of claim in his reply. 4.9 If the claimant does not receive the potential defendant’s substantive reply to his letter of claim within the requisite timeframe stipulated in paragraph 4.5, he may commence proceedings without any sanction by the Court. 4.10 The letter of claim and the responses are not intended to have the effect of pleadings in an action. 5. Third parties 5.1 Where a potential defendant wishes to bring in a third party, he must inform the claimant and the other potential defendants by letter within 14 days of receipt of the claimant’s letter of claim. The potential defendant shall send to the third party and his insurer a letter each setting out full particulars of his claim against the third party together with a copy each of the claimant’s letter of claim and all relevant supporting documents within the same period. The potential defendant’s letter to the third party must also instruct the third party to immediately pass the letter and the documents to his insurer if he wishes to claim under his insurance policy. This letter must be copied to the claimant. 5.2 The protocol set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 is applicable to the third party or, if he is claiming under his insurance policy, his insurer, as though the potential defendant were the claimant, and the third party or his insurer as the case may be, were the potential defendant. 6. Fourth parties 6.1 Paragraph 5 shall apply with the necessary modifications to fourth party proceedings and so on. All correspondences between the parties must be copied to all the other parties involved in the accident. 7. Potential defendant to bear claimant’s loss of use arising from pre-repair survey and/or post-repair inspection 7.1 The potential defendant must compensate the claimant for the loss of use of his vehicle computed from the date of receipt of the claimant’s notice of accident until the date the claimant is notified in writing that — (a) the pre-repair survey is completed and he may proceed to repair his vehicle; or (b) the insurer is waiving the requirement for pre-repair survey and he may proceed to repair his vehicle, as the case may be, inclusive of any intervening Saturday, Sunday or public holiday. 7.2 Where the insurer fails to respond to the claimant within 2 working days of receipt of the notice of accident as to whether he wishes to carry out or waive a pre-repair survey, the claimant may proceed to repair the vehicle and the potential defendant must compensate the claimant for the loss of use of his vehicle computed over 2 working days, inclusive of any intervening Saturday, Sunday or public holiday. 7.3 For avoidance of doubt, the compensation payable to the claimant for loss of use in the instances set out in paragraphs 7.1 and 7.2 is additional to any other claim for loss of use which the claimant may bring against the potential defendant. 7.4 Where an insurer requests for post-repair inspection pursuant to paragraph 4.1, the potential defendant must compensate the claimant for the loss of use of his vehicle for the day that the inspection is conducted. 8. Negotiation 8.1 Where the claimant’s position on liability differs from the potential defendant’s, the claimant must within 2 weeks from the date of receipt of the potential defendant’s reply to the letter of claim, make a counter-offer on liability. The claimant must specify the particular scenario in the Motor Accident Guide that is applicable to his account of the accident and enclose a copy of the relevant page of the Motor Accident Guide (Form 4A in this protocol may be used with the necessary modifications). 8.2 After all the relevant information and documents have been exchanged (including any pre-repair and post-repair survey/inspection report(s)), the parties shall negotiate with a view to settling the matter at the earliest opportunity on both liability and quantum. Litigation should not be commenced prematurely if there are reasonable prospects for a settlement. 8.3 If, after reasonable effort has been made to settle the matter, but there are no reasonable prospects of settlement after a time period of at least 8 weeks from the date of receipt of the letter of claim, save where paragraph 4.4 or 4.9 of this protocol applies, the claimant must give 10 clear days’ notice (Form 5 in this protocol), by e-mail, fax or certificate of posting to the potential defendant of his intention to proceed with a writ. He must also inform the potential defendant of the names of all the parties he is suing. 9. Pre-action costs 9.1 Where parties have settled both liability and quantum before any action is commenced, a claimant who has sought legal representation to put forward his claim will have incurred legal costs. A guide to the costs to be paid is as follows: Sum settled (excluding interest if any) Costs allowed (exclusive of disbursements) Less than $1,000 $300 $1,000 to $9,999 $300 to $700 $10,000 and above $500 to $1,000 10. Costs sanctions in relation to pre-repair survey and post repair inspection 10.1 Where the claimant has without good reason repaired or caused repairs to be carried out to his vehicle without first complying with paragraph 2 of this protocol in relation to pre-repair survey, then on account of the omission, the court may impose costs sanctions against the claimant. 10.2 Where the defendant disputes the damage to the claimant’s vehicle and after the commencement of Court proceedings requests for an inspection of the claimant’s vehicle without good reason, the Court may impose costs sanctions against the defendant. 11. Early agreement on liability 11.1 Where parties have agreed on the issue of liability prior to the commencement of proceedings and wish to issue a writ in order for damages to be assessed, the plaintiff must file a writ endorsed with a simplified statement of claim (Form 6 in this protocol). If no appearance is entered after the writ is served, the plaintiff may, in the manner prescribed under the Rules of Court, proceed to enter default interlocutory judgment and take out a summons for directions for the assessment of damages. If an appearance is entered, the plaintiff may take out a summons for interlocutory judgment to be entered and for directions for the assessment of damages. 12. Lodgement of claims below $3,000 with FIDReC 12.1 This paragraph applies to non-injury motor accident claims where the damages claimed before apportionment of liability is below $3,000 excluding survey fees, interests, costs and disbursements. 12.2 Unless the case falls within one or more of the exceptions listed in paragraph 13 of this protocol, the claimant shall in every case referred to in paragraph 12.1, lodge his claim with FIDReC at first instance. Upon lodgement, the claim shall be dealt with by FIDReC in accordance with its Terms of Reference relating to the management and resolution of such claims. 12.3 Notwithstanding that the claim is to be lodged with FIDReC, the claimant and potential defendant shall comply with the requirements of this protocol. In this connection, references to the “Court”, writ/Court action and proceedings in this protocol shall refer to “FIDReC”, the lodgement of a claim at FIDReC and proceedings at FIDReC respectively. 13. Exceptions to FIDReC proceedings 13.1 In any case where – (a) the claimant is a body corporate or partnership; (b) one or more of the vehicles involved in the accident is a government, a foreign-registered or diplomatic vehicle; (c) the potential defendant has a counterclaim of $3,000 or more; (d) the potential defendant has a counterclaim of less than $3,000 but the claimant is not claiming under his own insurance policy in respect of the counterclaim; (e) the insurer for the claim or counterclaim has repudiated liability; (f) an allegation that the claim, counterclaim or defence is tainted by fraud or other conduct constituting a criminal offence in connection with which a police report has been lodged; (g) proceedings are still ongoing at FIDReC after a lapse of 6 months from the date when all the relevant documents pertaining to the accident that were requested by FIDReC have been submitted or, from the date of the claimant’s first interview at FIDReC, whichever is later; or (h) there is other good and sufficient reason shown to the Court why the claim ought not to have been lodged at FIDReC or the proceedings ought not to have continued at FIDReC, the claimant may commence an action in Court directly and all proceedings (if any) before FIDReC shall be abated forthwith, unless the Court otherwise directs. 14. Costs sanctions for non-compliance with requirement to lodge the claim/continue with proceedings at FIDReC 14.1 Where the claimant in a case to which paragraph 12.1 of this protocol applies, has commenced an action in Court, the Court in exercising its discretion as to costs, shall have regard to the following, where applicable: (a) commencement of court proceedings before adjudication of the claim by FIDReC; (b) a finding by the Court that the quantum of damages before apportionment of liability is below $3,000 excluding survey fees, interests, costs and disbursements and the damages quantified and pleaded in the Statement of Claim is for an amount exceeding $3,000; or (c) the claimant has failed to obtain a judgment that is more favourable than the award made at the adjudication of the claim by FIDReC. 14.2 The Court will not impose sanctions on the claimant where there are good reasons for non-compliance, for example attempt(s) made to resolve the claim through the Singapore Mediation Centre or the Law Society of Singapore Arbitration Scheme. 14.3 Where the claimant has commenced Court proceedings before adjudication of the claim by FIDReC, the Court may stay the action under Order 34A of the Rules of Court to enable the claimant to lodge his claim and/or complete the proceedings at FIDReC. 15. Application of the Limitation Act (Cap. 163) 15.1 For the avoidance of doubt, the lodgement of a claim and/or continuation of proceedings at FIDReC shall not be construed to operate as a stay of the time limited for the doing of any act as prescribed by the Limitation Act (Cap. 163). 15.2 Should Court proceedings be commenced to prevent the operation of the time bar under the Limitation Act (Cap.163), the Court may nevertheless stay the action thereafter to enable the claimant to lodge his claim and/or complete the proceedings at FIDReC.

"text": "Appendix D: Protocol for Medical Negligence Claims Part One: Pre-Action Specific Discovery of Documents** 1. Application 1.1 The aim of Part One of the Protocol for Medical Negligence Claims (“the protocol”) is to prescribe a framework for pre-writ exchange of documents, information and communication with a view to resolve medical negligence disputes arising out of a negligent act or omission in the course of medical or dental treatment without protracted litigation and to maintain/restore the patient/healthcare provider relationship. 1.2 Part One of the protocol will apply from the time a potential claimant contemplates filing a medical negligence claim in Court. Prior to such time, either party is at liberty to communicate, correspond or negotiate with the opposing party in any manner they see fit. 1.3 This protocol does not affect any privilege that may apply to communication between parties undertaken in compliance with it (including medical reports and medical records furnished to the claimant’s solicitor by the doctor and/or the hospital (“health care provider”) pursuant to this protocol).      1.4 For avoidance of doubt, this protocol equally applies to actions arising from dental treatments. 2. Letter of request for medical report and other related medical records 2.1 Generally, to enable the claimant to consider whether he has a viable cause of action against the health care provider for medical negligence, a medical report and medical records of the patient from the health care provider are essential. The application for the medical report and medical records that may be necessary for the claimant and/or his solicitor to ascertain if there is a cause of action should be made by letter (see Form 1 below) setting out briefly the basis of the claim and the nature of the information sought in the medical report, including: (a) symptoms presented by the claimant or the deceased (where the patient has passed away and the claimant is the deceased’s next-of-kin or executor or administrator of his estate) prior to treatment; (b) clinical findings; (c) diagnosis; (d) treatment prescribed, whether there are risks in such treatment and if so, when and how such risks were communicated to the claimant or the deceased and/or his next-of-kin; (e) whether alternatives to the prescribed treatment were disclosed to the claimant or the deceased and/or his next-of-kin and if so, why the prescribed treatment was preferred over these alternatives; (f) assessment of the claimant’s or the deceased’s condition at the last consultation and the cause of such condition or the cause of the deceased’s death; (g) prognosis and recommended future treatment, if available. 2.2 The above guidelines on the contents of the medical report are meant to ensure that the report is as comprehensive as possible. Depending on the facts and nature of the medical management in each case, the contents of the medical report may be suitably modified. The application for the medical report may be dispensed with where the harm caused to the patient is res ipsa loquitur. 2.3 If the claimant and/or his solicitor wish to obtain copies of medical records from the health care provider, this should also be made clear in the letter. The various types of medical records that the claimant and/or his solicitor may seek from the health care provider are set out in Form 1. The medical records listed in Form 1 are not exhaustive, but act as guides. The claimant and/or his solicitor may request any other medical records that are relevant and necessary for the claim, which can depend on the nature and focus of the complaint, the type of medical treatment rendered and advice sought as well as whether the health care provider is a doctor or hospital. 2.4 The application for the medical report and medical records should be accompanied by the claimant’s letter (see Form 1A below) authorising the health care provider to release the medical report and medical reports to the claimant’s solicitor. 2.5 Within 7 days of receipt of the application, the health care provider shall inform the claimant what the requisite charges are for the medical report and medical records. 2.6 The medical report and medical records should be provided to the claimant within 6 weeks upon payment of the requisite charges. The claimant may where necessary, seek further information or clarification from the health care provider on any aspect of the report, in which case, the health care provider should respond within 4 weeks from receipt of the further request. 2.7 If the health care provider has difficulty complying with the timeline prescribed above, the problem and reason for the difficulty must be explained to the claimant in writing and the necessary extension of time sought. 2.8 If the health care provider fails to provide the requisite medical report, medical records and/or clarification within the timeline prescribed above or agreed extension period, the claimant may proceed to apply to the Court for an order for pre-action discovery under Order 24 Rule 6 of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5), without further notice to the health care provider. The Court will take into account any unreasonable delay in providing the medical report, medical records and/or clarification when considering the issue of costs. 3. Letter of request for discussion 3.1 Upon receipt of the medical report and/or medical records and before commencement of legal proceedings, the claimant is to write to the health care provider against whom he intends to pursue his claim to arrange for a without prejudice discussion (see Form 2 below). The health care provider must respond within 14 days after receipt of the letter, proposing a date and time for the meeting which should be held within 2 months from the date of the letter of request. This important step opens additional channels of communication between the health care provider and claimant, affording the health care provider an opportunity to explain medical procedures to the claimant and for the claimant to clarify with the health care provider any queries or doubts which he may have. Quite often, legal proceedings are taken because of miscommunication between the health care provider and patient or because the patient interprets a perceived lack of information and empathy as lack of due care and attention on the part of the health care provider. Hence, such discussions may pave the way for an amicable resolution of the claim. To facilitate the discussion, either party may in suitable cases, engage a separate or joint third party medical opinion on the medical management provided. 3.2 The letter to the health care provider is to be sent by way of A R Registered mail or by hand (in which case an acknowledgment of receipt should be obtained). 3.3 If the health care provider fails to propose a date and time for the meeting within the requisite 14 days or if without reasonable cause, the meeting is not held within the requisite 2 months, the claimant may commence proceedings without any sanction by the Court. 4. Negotiation 4.1 After the initial discussion, the parties are at liberty to correspond or negotiate with each other in any manner they see fit with a view to resolving the matter amicably at the earliest opportunity. Litigation should not be commenced prematurely if there are reasonable prospects for resolution. Where reasonable effort has been made without reasonable prospects of resolution, and after the expiry of 2 months from the date of request for a without prejudice discussion, save where paragraph 3.3 applies, the claimant must give 10 clear days’ notice, by letter (see Form 3 below) to the potential defendant of his intention to proceed with a writ. He is also to inform each potential defendant, to the best of his knowledge, the names of all the parties he is contemplating to sue. 4.2 Where the claim is affected by limitation and/or the claimant’s position needs to be protected by the early commencement of an action, the claimant need only comply with this protocol as far as he is able. Part Two: COMMENCEMENT OF SUIT AND PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS** 5. Application 5.1 Part Two of the protocol relates to the commencement of proceedings for medical negligence and the pre-trial procedures in such cases. 6. Filing of medical reports and lists of documents 6.1 A claimant commencing a medical negligence suit in Court is required under Order 18 Rule 12(1A) to file and serve a medical report and a statement of the special damages claimed with the Statement of Claim. The medical report(s) should include expert report(s) that the claimant intends to rely on. 6.2 The defendant is also required to file and serve a medical report within 6 weeks after the filing of the memorandum of appearance. 6.3 For cases that are subject to the simplified process under Order 108 of the Rules of Court (Magistrate’s Court cases filed on or after 1st November 2014 and by consent, District Court cases filed on or after 1st November 2014), each party is required to file and serve a list of documents together with the relevant pleading on the other party within the time limited for the service of such pleading under Order 108 Rule 2(4) of the Rules of Court. 6.4 For cases that are not subject to the simplified process, if there are documents other than the medical report filed with a claimant’s pleading and the medical report that will be filed by a defendant under paragraph 6.2 which are: (a) documents on which a party relies or will rely; and (b) documents which could — (i) adversely affect a party’s own case; (ii) adversely affect another party’s case; or (iii) support another party’s case, that party is required to file and serve a list of documents on the other party within 6 weeks after the filing of the memorandum of appearance using Form 37 of Appendix A of the Rules of Court. 7. Steps to be taken after close of pleadings 7.1 In order to encourage parties to delineate undisputed facts and issues at an early stage, parties are required to file a list of undisputed facts and issues 2 weeks after the close of pleadings or as directed by the Court. 7.2 Currently, a party may file a notice to admit facts under Order 27 Rule 2 of the Rules of Court only after a matter is set down for trial. For medical negligence cases, such a notice to admit may be served at any time after the close of pleadings. 8. CDR session 8.1 For all medical negligence cases that are filed in Court, the Court will convene the first CDR session under Order 34A of the Rules of Court within 2 weeks after the filing of the memorandum of appearance. 8.2 At the first CDR session, parties will explore the possibility of resolving the case by mediation, neutral evaluation, conciliation or other forms of CDR under the prevailing CDR framework. Solicitors for all parties seeking an indication on liability must submit a duly completed “Liability Indication Form (Medical Negligence Claims)” (see Form 4 below) to the Court at the CDR session. Whether or not an indication on liability is given, the Court may, at its own discretion in appropriate cases or at solicitors’ request, provide an indication on quantum. Solicitors requesting for an indication on quantum must obtain each other’s consent before the CDR session, and submit the duly completed Quantum Indication Form (i.e. Form 9B in Appendix A) to the Court. 8.3 No directions for general discovery will be given as most discovery of documents would have taken place at the pre-action stage and pleadings stage. However, parties may apply for specific discovery as provided for under the Rules of Court. 8.4 The Court may, where appropriate, appoint a medical professional to co-mediate at the CDR session. 9. Compliance with the protocol 9.1 In the interest of saving time and costs, claimants are expected to use this protocol as a checklist on the required steps to be taken before commencing court proceedings and during pre-trial proceedings. Parties must comply with the terms of the protocol in substance and spirit. A breach by one party will not exempt the other parties in the claim from following the protocol insofar as they are able. 9.2 In exercising its discretion and powers, the Court will have regard to compliance with this protocol or lack thereof, including staying an action for the party in default to comply with the protocol, and in determining the amount of costs to be awarded under Order 59 Rule 5 of the Rules of Court. 9.3 Where there are good reasons for non-compliance, the Court will not impose sanctions against the party in default.

"url": "/Appendices.html#appendix-e-pre-action-protocol-for-personal-injury-claims",
"text": "Appendix E: Pre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims 1. Application 1.1 The object of this protocol is to streamline the management of personal injury claims and promote early settlement of such claims. It prescribes a framework for pre-writ negotiation and exchange of information. 1.2 This protocol applies to all personal injury claims including — (a) all personal injury claims including — (i) claims arising out of motor accidents and industrial accidents; (ii) personal injury claims (whether or not involving any claim for property damage arising from the same accident); and (iii) claims arising from fatal accidents occurring on or after 1st April 2016 that are to be filed in the Magistrate’s Court or the District Court, as the case may be, but does not apply to medical negligence claims; and (b) all personal injury claims arising out of motor accidents (whether or not involving any claim for property damage arising out of the same accident) and industrial accidents occurring on or after 1st December 2016 that are to be filed in the High Court (and subsequently transferred to the District Court). 1.3 Any reference to “the potential defendant” in this protocol refers to the potential defendant if he is not claiming under his insurance policy, or to his insurer if he is claiming under his policy. 1.4 Any reference to an “insurer” in this protocol refers to an insurer that is known or could be reasonably known to the claimant/plaintiff or his solicitors. 1.5 This protocol does not affect any privilege that may apply to any communication between the parties that is undertaken in compliance with it. 1.6 This protocol encourages the parties to jointly select medical experts before proceedings commence. 2. Application of the Pre-Action Protocol for Non-Injury Motor Accident Cases 2.1 For motor accident cases, the provisions of the Pre-Action Protocol for Non-Injury Motor Accident Cases at Appendix C of these Practice Directions relating to — (a) the conduct of a pre-repair survey and post repair inspection of the claimant’s vehicle, including the joint selection and appointment by the parties of a motor surveyor as a single joint expert to conduct the pre-repair survey, shall apply to mixed claims for personal injury and property damage arising from the same accident (“mixed claims”); and (b) the use of the Motor Accident Guide in negotiations between the parties to resolve the issue of liability shall apply to mixed claims and to personal injury claims. 3. Letter of Claim 3.1 The claimant must send a letter of claim (Form 1 in this protocol) to every potential defendant and his insurer. 3.2 The letter of claim must set out the full particulars of his claim, including the following information: (a) a brief statement of all the relevant and available facts on which the claim is based; (b) a brief description of the nature of the injuries suffered; (c) an estimate of general and special damages with a breakdown of the heads of claim; (d) the names of all witnesses (where possible to disclose); (e) the case reference numbers, identity and contact particulars of the officer having charge of any investigations (e.g. the police officer or the relevant officer from the Ministry of Manpower); and (f) the results of any prosecution or Court proceedings arising from the accident and where the claimant has passed away, the State Coroner’s verdict, where available. 3.3 In respect of claims where — (a) the estimated quantum falls within the jurisdiction of a Magistrate’s Court before any apportionment of liability (but excluding interest); and (b) the claimant intends to appoint one or more experts for the purpose of the proceedings, the claimant shall include his proposed list of medical expert(s) in each relevant specialty in his letter of claim. The claimant should preferably include the doctors who provided him treatment and/or review of his medical condition in his proposed list. 3.4 In respect of claims where the estimated quantum exceeds the jurisdiction of a Magistrate’s Court, the claimant and the potential defendant and/or their respective insurers are encouraged, to follow the procedure set out in paragraph 4.3 of this protocol for the appointment of a mutually agreed medical expert. 3.5 If the claimant is non-resident in Singapore, the letter of claim must further state the date the claimant is required to depart from Singapore once the relevant permits expire or are cancelled and, where available, the date of his intended departure from Singapore. This is to afford the potential defendant or his insurer an opportunity to arrange for a medical examination of the claimant by a medical expert mutually agreed by both parties in each relevant specialty, or where there is no agreement, a medical re-examination of the claimant by a medical expert appointed by the potential defendant or his insurer prior to the claimant’s departure from Singapore. 3.6 The claimant must enclose with his letter of claim a list of all the relevant documents relating to both liability and quantum. 3.7 In respect of the issue of liability, the claimant must enclose with his letter of claim a copy each of all relevant supporting documents, where available, such as the following: For motor accident cases: (a) full and complete Singapore Accident Statements and police reports together with type-written transcripts of all persons involved in the accident; (b) police sketch plan or, if that is unavailable, the claimant’s sketch of the accident; (c) results of police investigations or outcome of prosecution for any traffic offence(s) arising from the accident; (d) police vehicle damage reports; (e) original, coloured copies or scanned photographs of damage to all vehicles; (f) original, coloured copies or scanned photographs of the accident scene; (g) video recording of the accident (if any); (h) accident reconstruction report (if any); and (i) any other supporting documents.

For personal injury claims not involving motor and industrial accidents: (a) claimant’s sketch of the accident; (b) original, coloured copies or scanned photographs of the accident scene; (c) video recording of the accident (if any); and (d) any other supporting documents. 3.8 In respect of the issue of quantum, the claimant must enclose with his letter of claim a copy of each of all relevant supporting documents, where available, such as the following: (a) medical reports from the treating doctor, reviewing doctor and medical specialist; (b) certificates for hospitalisation and medical leave; (c) bills for medical treatment and evidence of payment; (d) income tax notices of assessment and/or other evidence of income and loss thereof; and (e) supporting documents for all other expenses claimed (if any). For mixed claims Where the claim is for both personal injury and property damage, the claimant must in addition, enclose with his letter of claim a copy each of all relevant documents supporting the claim for property damage, such as the following: (a) repairer’s bill and evidence of payment; (b) motor surveyor’s report; (c) excess bill or receipt; (d) vehicle registration card; (e) COE/PARF certificates; (f) rental agreement, invoice and receipt for rental of replacement vehicle (if any); (g) correspondences with the insurer relating to pre-repair survey and/or post repair inspection of the claimant’s vehicle; and (h) supporting documents for all other expenses claimed (if any). 3.9 The letter of claim must also instruct the potential defendant to immediately pass the letter and the documents to his insurer if he wishes to claim under his insurance policy. If the potential defendant’s insurer is known to the claimant, a copy of the letter of claim must be sent directly to the insurer. The letters to any other potential defendants must be copied to the rest of the parties. The letter(s) to the potential defendant(s) must be sent by way of e-mail, fax or certificate of posting. The letters to insurers must be sent by way of e-mail, fax, A.R. Registered mail or by hand (in which case an acknowledgement of receipt should be obtained). 3.10 Where it is not possible to comply with any of the above requirements in notifying the relevant persons or providing documents, the claimant must provide his explanation in the letter of claim. 4. Potential Defendant’s response Acknowledgment letter 4.1 The potential defendant must send an acknowledgement letter (Form 2 or Form 2A in this protocol) to the claimant within 14 days from the date of receipt of the letter of claim. If he is ready to take a position on the claim, he must state his position. If not, he must first send an acknowledgement. 4.2 If the claimant does not receive an acknowledgement letter from the potential defendant within the requisite 14 days, he may commence proceedings without any sanction by the Court. Joint selection of medical experts 4.3 In respect of claims where the estimated quantum falls within the jurisdiction of a Magistrate’s Court, within 14 days of sending the acknowledgment letter to the claimant, the potential defendant shall send a letter to the claimant stating whether he agrees or has any objections to the appointment of any of the medical experts proposed by the claimant for the relevant specialty. (a) If the potential defendant agrees to any of the proposed medical experts, the claimant shall send the medical expert in each of the relevant specialty a letter of appointment within 14 days. The medical expert mutually agreed upon by both parties shall be referred to as the ‘single joint expert’. (b) The letter of appointment must be copied to the potential defendant. A medical report form (Form 4 or 4A in this protocol, as applicable) may be sent to the single joint expert. Form 4 may be used for higher value and/or more complex claims. (c) If the potential defendant objects to all the proposed medical experts for any relevant specialty, the potential defendant must state the reasons for his objections and provide the name(s) of one or more medical experts in each relevant specialty whom he considers as suitable to appoint. The claimant shall within 14 days from the date of receipt of the letter from the potential defendant state if he has any objections to the appointment of any of the medical experts proposed by the potential defendant for the relevant specialty. (d) If the claimant agrees to any of the proposed medical experts, the claimant shall send the medical expert in each of the relevant specialty a letter of appointment within 14 days. The medical expert mutually agreed upon by both parties shall be referred to as the ‘single joint expert’. (e) The letter of appointment must be copied to the potential defendant. A medical report form (Form 4 or 4A in this protocol, as applicable) may be sent to the single joint expert. (f) If the potential defendant or claimant fails to reply or fails in his reply to object to any of the medical experts listed in the other party’s letter within the timeline stipulated by this protocol, the party who fails to reply or to object is deemed to have agreed to the appointment of any of the medical experts proposed by the other party as a single joint expert. (g) The costs of the medical examination of the claimant and medical report to be provided by the single joint expert shall be paid first by the claimant who may seek to recover the cost as part of his claim for reasonable disbursements. (h) Either party may send the single joint expert written questions relevant to the issues or matters on which the medical report is sought. The questions must be copied to the other party. (i) If the claimant objects to the medical experts proposed by the potential defendant for any relevant specialty, both parties are not precluded from instructing medical experts of their own choice for each relevant specialty that the parties are unable to agree upon. Should the potential defendant wish to arrange for the claimant to undergo a medical examination by his own medical expert, the potential defendant shall within 14 days from the date of receipt of the claimant’s letter of reply, propose a date and time on which the claimant is to undergo the medical examination. The address at which the claimant must present himself for the medical examination must also be provided. However, if the estimated quantum falls within the jurisdiction of a Magistrate’s Court, parties are to be aware of Order 108, Rule 5(3) of the Rules of Court on the appointment of a single joint expert should the matter be unresolved subsequently and proceed for a simplified trial. Both parties shall in any event not unreasonably withhold consent to the appointment of a single joint expert as far as possible. Substantive reply to claimant 4.4 If the potential defendant replies to the claimant with only an acknowledgement of receipt, within 8 weeks from the date of receipt of the letter of claim, the potential defendant must reply to the claimant substantively. For this purpose, the following provisions will apply: (a) The reply shall indicate whether the insurer is defending the claim or whether the defendant is defending the claim personally. Reasons for the insurer’s decision not to act must be provided. (b) Subject to sub-paragraph (d) below, the reply must state the potential defendant’s position on the claim on both liability and quantum (e.g. whether the claim is admitted or denied) or make an offer of settlement. If the claim is not admitted in full, the potential defendant must give reasons and provide a list of documents together with copies of all relevant supporting documents. Singapore Accident Statements and police reports provided by the potential defendant must be full and complete and must reflect the names, identification numbers and addresses of all persons involved in the accident together with type-written transcripts of their factual accounts of the accident. (c) If the insurer is the party replying to the claimant, the reply must also state the name(s), telephone number(s) and fax number(s) of the insurance officer(s) handling the matter and the insurer’s file reference number(s), to facilitate correspondence. (d) Pending the receipt of the medical report from the single joint expert or other medical expert appointed under paragraph 4.3 and/or inspection report of the claimant’s vehicle pursuant to the Pre-Action Protocol for Non-Injury Motor Accident Cases (as the case may be), the reply must state the potential defendant’s position on liability and his preliminary position on quantum or, if he is unable to do so, reserve his position on quantum. Within 14 days of receipt of the medical report from the medical expert and/or the vehicle inspection report, the potential defendant must state his position on quantum (e.g. whether the quantum claimed is admitted or denied) or make an offer of settlement. 4.5 If the claimant does not receive the potential defendant’s substantive reply to his letter of claim within the requisite 8 weeks stipulated in paragraph 4.4, he may commence proceedings without any sanction by the Court. 5. Counterclaim 5.1 If the potential defendant has a counterclaim, he must include it in his reply, giving full particulars of the counterclaim together with all relevant supporting documents. If the potential defendant is pursuing his counterclaim separately, i.e. his insurer is only handling his defence but not his counterclaim, the potential defendant must send a letter to the claimant giving full particulars of the counterclaim together with all relevant supporting documents within 8 weeks from receipt of the letter of claim. If the potential defendant has already furnished particulars in a separate letter of claim, he need only refer to that letter of claim in his reply. 5.2 Where the counterclaim includes a personal injury, paragraphs 3 and 4 above shall apply with the necessary modifications. 5.3 The letter of claim and the responses are not intended to have the effect of pleadings in the action. 6. Third parties 6.1 Where a potential defendant wishes to bring in a third party, he must inform the claimant and the other potential defendants by letter within 14 days of receipt of the claimant’s letter of claim. The potential defendant shall send to the third party and his insurer a letter each setting out full particulars of his claim against the third party together with a copy each of the claimant’s letter of claim and all relevant supporting documents within the same period. The potential defendant’s letter to the third party must also expressly instruct the third party to immediately pass the letter and the documents to his insurer if he wishes to claim under his insurance policy. This letter must be copied to the claimant. 6.2 The protocol set out in paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 is applicable to the third party or, if he is claiming under his insurance policy, his insurer, as though the potential defendant were the claimant and the third party, or his insurer as the case may be, were the potential defendant. 7. Fourth parties 7.1 Paragraph 6 shall apply with the necessary modifications to fourth party proceedings and so on. All correspondences between the parties must be copied to all the other parties involved in the accident. 8. Medical reports 8.1 Subject to any litigation privilege, any party who receives a medical report from his medical expert or the single joint expert must within 7 days of its receipt send a copy of the report to every other party. For the avoidance of doubt, these are medical reports which the parties intend to rely on for the purpose of litigation and neither party need disclose to the other medical reports (if any) that he is not relying on. 9. Other information and documents 9.1 Any party who subsequently receives any information or document that was previously unknown or unavailable must, within 7 days of the receipt, provide every other party with that information or document. 10. Negotiation 10.1 After all the relevant information and documents have been exchanged or as soon as it is practicable, the parties shall negotiate with a view to settling the matter at the earliest opportunity on both liability and quantum. Litigation should not be commenced prematurely if there are reasonable prospects for a settlement. 10.2 If, after reasonable effort has been made to settle the matter, but there are no reasonable prospects of settlement after a time period of at least 8 weeks from the date of receipt of the letter of claim, save where paragraphs 4.2 or 4.5 apply, the claimant may commence legal action after giving — (a) 2 clear days’ notice (Form 3 in this protocol) by e-mail, fax or certificate of posting to the insurer; or (b) 7 clear days’ notice (Form 3 in this protocol) by e-mail, fax or certificate of posting to the potential defendant, where the defence is not handled by an insurer. 10.3 Where the claimant has earlier given notice that the offer being made was final, and legal proceedings would be commenced in the event that the potential defendant did not accept the offer within the specified timeframe, Form 3 need not be sent. 11. Interim payment 11.1 The claimant may in his letter of claim or in a letter sent at any time subsequent thereto, seek one or more pre-writ interim payment(s) of damages from the potential defendant. The claimant must state in his letter — (a) the amount he is seeking as interim payment; or (b) where the interim payment is sought specifically for anticipated expenses (e.g. surgery or a course of physiotherapy), an estimate of the expenditure to be incurred, and provide any supporting documents which have not already been furnished to the potential defendant. 11.2 The potential defendant must reply to the claimant within 14 days of receipt of the letter, stating whether or not the request for interim payment is acceded to and the amount offered. Reasons must be given in the reply if the request is not acceded to in full. Unless the claimant states otherwise, any sum which the potential defendant offers as an interim payment, regardless as to whether the request is acceded to in full or in part, shall be paid to the claimant within 28 days of the potential defendant’s reply. 12. Costs Guidelines 12.1 Where parties have settled both liability and quantum before any action is commenced, a claimant who has sought legal representation to put forward his claim will have incurred costs. As a guide, where the sum settled (excluding interest if any) is less than $20,000, the pre-action costs should be between $1,500 and $2,500, exclusive of disbursements. 12.2 Where after commencing an action, both liability and quantum are settled by the parties or decided by the Court (as the case may be) and the sum that is — (a) settled; (b) awarded, where the Plaintiff is successful; or (c) claimed, where the Plaintiff is unsuccessful, is less than $20,000 (excluding interest, if any), the Court will in general, award costs based on the guidelines below: Stage of proceedings Costs allowed (exclusive of disbursements) Upon filing of writ $1,800-$2,800 Upon signing of affidavits of evidence-in-chief $2,500-$4,200 Upon setting down for trial $3,000-$4,500 1st day of trial or part thereof $4,000-$5,000 Subsequent day of trial or part thereof/Assessment of damages Up to $1,000 per day or part thereof 13. Exceptions 13.1 The Court will not impose sanctions where there are good reasons for non-compliance with the provisions of this protocol, for example attempt(s) made to resolve the claim through the Singapore Mediation Centre or the Law Society of Singapore Arbitration Scheme. 13.2. The protocol prescribes the timelines to be given to a potential defendant to investigate and respond to a claim before proceedings are commenced. This may not always be possible where a claimant only consults his lawyer close to the end of any relevant limitation period. In such a case, the claimant must give as much notice of the intention to commence proceedings as practicable and the parties shall consider whether the Court might be invited to extend time for service of the pleadings or alternatively, to stay the proceedings while the requirements of this protocol are being complied with. 14. Early agreement on liability 14.1 Where parties have agreed on the issue of liability prior to the commencement of proceedings and wish to issue a writ in order for damages to be assessed, the plaintiff must file a writ endorsed with a simplified statement of claim. If no appearance is entered after the writ is served, the plaintiff may, in the manner prescribed under the Rules of Court, proceed to enter default interlocutory judgment and take out a summons for directions for the assessment of damages. If an appearance is entered, the plaintiff may take out a summons for interlocutory judgment to be entered and for directions for the assessment of damages.

(4) Inspection and copies (a) Arrangements for inspection. The place for inspection of discoverable electronic documents should be stated separately if it is different from the place for inspection of other discoverable documents. If the party entitled to inspect intends to inspect through or with the assistance of its appointed computer expert, such computer expert shall provide an undertaking of confidentiality to the party giving inspection before he commences his inspection. (b) Supply of copies. During inspection, copies shall not be taken. If copies are required, a request should be made. Electronic copies of discoverable documents will be supplied in their native format and in read-only optical discs upon request. Electronic copies of discoverable documents where privilege is claimed only with respect to their internally stored metadata information will be supplied in the Tagged Image File Format (or TIFF) with privileged metadata information removed. For each of the read-only optical discs supplied, a further list stating the storage format (and its version) of the optical disc and enumerating the list of electronic documents stored therein shall be provided.

(7) Discovery and production only if necessary For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this protocol shall compel any party to give discovery of any document or produce any document for inspection which is not otherwise discoverable under Order 24, Rules 7 or 13 of the Rules of Court. Part 2: Protocol for Inspection of Computer Databases and Electronic Media or Recording Devices (1) Appointment of computer experts (a) Joint appointment. The party producing the computer database, electronic medium or recording device for inspection (“the Producing Party”) and the party entitled to inspection of the computer database, electronic medium or recording device (“the Inspecting Party”), may jointly appoint a computer expert (“the Joint Expert”) for the purpose of making a forensic copy of such computer database, electronic medium or recording device (“the Original Acquired Image”). The Joint Expert’s role shall be restricted to the acquisition of the Original Acquired Image and the performance of a reasonable search on a copy of the Original Acquired Image in accordance with the terms of this protocol. Before the Joint Expert commences his appointment, he shall provide an undertaking of confidentiality to the Court and to all parties concerned in the inspection. He shall also procure a similar undertaking from each of his employees, representatives, agents or sub-contractors involved in the engagement. (b) Costs and expenses of Joint Expert. All costs and expenses relating to the appointment of the Joint Expert under this protocol shall initially be borne equally between the Producing Party and the Inspecting Party. Nothing in this protocol is intended to or shall be taken to prevent any party to the cause or matter from seeking the recovery of such costs and expenses in accordance with the Rules of Court. (c) Individual appointments. Nothing in this protocol shall prevent the Producing Party, the Inspecting Party and any other party concerned in the inspection from appointing his own computer expert. (2) Acquisition of the Original Acquired Image (a) Where Joint Expert appointed. The Joint Expert shall acquire the Original Acquired Image under the supervision of all parties concerned in the inspection, their representatives or computer experts. Sufficient copies of the Original Acquired Image shall be made as necessary in order that the Producing Party and each Inspecting Party may be supplied with an electronic copy of the Original Acquired Image. The Joint Expert shall provide sufficient information with the copy of the Original Acquired Image to enable the party’s computer expert to access the copy supplied. The Original Acquired Image shall be sealed and delivered to the custody of the Producing Party, who shall enumerate it in a list of documents to be filed under Order 24 of the Rules of Court. (b) Where Joint Expert not appointed. The Producing Party’s computer expert shall be responsible for acquiring the Original Acquired Image under the supervision of all parties concerned in the inspection, their representatives or computer experts. Sufficient copies of the Original Acquired Image shall be made as necessary for the purposes of inspection and reasonable search to be provided under this protocol. The Original Acquired Image shall be sealed and delivered to the custody of the Producing Party, who shall enumerate it in a list of documents to be filed under Order 24 of the Rules of Court. (c)  Original Acquired Image to be produced when ordered by Court. The party to whose custody the sealed Original Acquired Image has been delivered shall not tamper with or break the seal, and shall produce the Original Acquired Image to the Court or such other person(s) as the Court may direct. (3) Safeguards for reasonable search This paragraph applies in situations where a reasonable search is conducted on the contents of a copy of the Original Acquired Image. Where Joint Expert appointed (a) Conduct of reasonable search. The Inspecting Party shall specify or describe the search terms or phrases to be used in a reasonable search to be conducted on the contents of a copy of the Original Acquired Image to the Producing Party and the Joint Expert. If the Producing Party does not object to the search terms or phrases so specified or described, he shall communicate his consent to the Joint Expert and the Inspecting Party. The Joint Expert shall make arrangements for the conduct of the reasonable search on a copy of the Original Acquired Image under the supervision of all parties concerned in the inspection, their representatives or computer experts. If the Producing Party objects to any or all of the search terms or phrases so specified or described, he shall forthwith inform the Joint Expert. The parties shall resolve such objections before any further steps are taken for the conduct of the reasonable search. The Joint Expert shall not take any further steps for the conduct of the reasonable search until: (i) he is informed by the Producing Party of his consent to the original search terms or phrases; or (ii) the Inspecting Party specifies or describes a new set of search terms or phrases and to which the Producing Party provides his consent in accordance with this sub-paragraph. A copy of the documents or records that are the results of the reasonable search (“the Search Results”) shall be made and released to the Producing Party. (b) Review for privileged material. The Producing Party shall be at liberty to review the Search Results for the purpose of claiming privilege. If the Producing Party claims privilege over any document or record from the Search Results, he shall list the electronic documents or records over which privilege is claimed. (c) Release for inspection. Thereafter, the Joint Expert shall remove copies of any documents or records over which privilege is claimed from the Search Results (“the Redacted Search Results”). The Joint Expert may maintain a separate privilege log which records the documents or records which are thus removed and the reasons given for doing so. For the avoidance of doubt, the privilege log shall not be included in the Joint Expert’s report but the Joint Expert shall produce the privilege log to the Court if so directed by the Court. The Redacted Search Results shall be released to the Inspecting Party for inspection together with the list of electronic documents or records over which privilege is claimed. Where Joint Expert not appointed (d) Conduct of reasonable search. The Inspecting Party shall specify or describe the search terms or phrases to be used in a reasonable search to be conducted on the contents of a copy of the Original Acquired Image to the Producing Party. If the Producing Party objects to any or all of the search terms or phrases so specified or described, parties shall resolve such objections before any further steps are taken for the conduct of the reasonable search. Upon resolution of any objections or if the Producing Party consents to the specified or described search terms or phrases, he shall make arrangements for his computer expert to conduct the requested reasonable search on a copy of the Original Acquired Image under the supervision of all parties concerned in the inspection, their representatives or computer experts. (e) Review for privileged material. The Producing Party shall be at liberty to review the Search Results for the purpose of claiming privilege. If the Producing Party claims privilege over any document or record from the Search Results, he shall list the electronic documents or records over which privilege is claimed. (f) Release for inspection. Thereafter, the Producing Party shall remove copies of any documents or records over which privilege is claimed from the Search Results. The Redacted Search Results shall be released to the Inspecting Party for inspection together with the list of electronic documents or records over which privilege is claimed. (4) Safeguards for forensic examination This paragraph applies to the forensic examination of a copy of the Original Acquired Image for the purpose of identifying electronically stored documents thereon or for the recovery of deleted files or file fragments from the unallocated file space or file slack using computer forensic tools or techniques. A Joint Expert shall be appointed for the purpose of such forensic examination. (a) Conduct of forensic examination. The Inspecting Party shall specify or describe the search terms or phrases to be used in the forensic examination to be conducted on the contents of a copy of the Original Acquired Image to the Joint Expert. The Joint Expert shall not at any time disclose to the Producing Party the search terms or phrases specified or described by the Inspecting Party and shall not include the search terms or phrases in his report. For the avoidance of doubt, the Joint Expert shall disclose the search terms or phrases to the Court if so directed by the Court. The Joint Expert shall make arrangements for the conduct of the forensic examination on a copy of the Original Acquired Image. Neither the Inspecting Party nor the Producing Party, or any of their solicitors, computer experts, employees, representatives or agents shall be present during the conduct of the forensic examination. A copy of the documents or records that are the results of the reasonable search (“the Search Results”) shall be made and released to the Producing Party. The Producing Party is not entitled to a copy, and shall not request the Joint Expert for a copy, of the search terms or phrases specified or described by the Inspecting Party. (b) Review for privileged material. The Joint Expert and the Producing Party shall jointly review the Search Results for the purpose of permitting the Producing Party to identify electronically stored documents, deleted files or file fragments over which he claims privilege. If the Producing Party claims privilege over any electronically stored documents, deleted files or file fragments from the Search Results, he shall identify them to the Joint Expert. The Producing Party shall list the electronic documents, deleted files or file fragments over which privilege is claimed. (c) Release for inspection. Thereafter, the Joint Expert shall remove copies of any electronic documents, deleted files or file fragments over which privilege is claimed from the Search Results (“the Redacted Search Results”). The Joint Expert may maintain a separate privilege log which records the electronic documents, deleted files or file fragments which are thus removed and the reasons provided for the removal. For the avoidance of doubt, the privilege log shall not be included in the Joint Expert’s report but the Joint Expert shall produce the privilege log to the Court if so directed by the Court. The Redacted Search Results shall be released to the Inspecting Party for inspection together with the Producing Party’s list of electronic documents, deleted files or file fragments over which privilege is claimed. (5) Inadvertent disclosure of privileged documents Notwithstanding compliance with the procedures in this protocol, nothing in this protocol is intended to be or shall be taken to amount to a waiver of privilege. (6) Discovery and production only if necessary For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this protocol shall compel any party to give discovery of any document or produce any document for inspection which is not otherwise discoverable under Order 24, Rules 7 or 13 of the Rules of Court.

"documentTitle": "State Courts Practice Directions 2014",
"url": "/Appendices.html#appendix-k---pre-action-protocol-for-defamation-actions",
"text": "Appendix K - Pre-Action Protocol for Defamation Actions 1. Application 1.1. This Protocol applies to all defamation (including libel and slander) actions. 1.2. Parties are expected to comply with the framework prescribed in this Protocol before commencing proceedings in the State Courts. 1.1.1. Notwithstanding this, parties may adapt the forms where necessary to suit the facts of their case. 1.1.2. This Protocol is in addition to any negotiations that parties may be conducting privately or on a “without prejudice” basis. 1.3. In following this Protocol, the parties should act reasonably to keep costs proportionate to the nature and gravity of the case and the stage the complaint has reached. 2. Objectives 2.1. This Protocol aims to: 2.1.1. improve pre-action communication between parties by establishing a timetable for the exchange of information and documents; 2.1.2. encourage constructive negotiations in order to improve the chances of a pre-action settlement; and 2.1.3. set standards for the content of pre-action correspondence between parties which will in turn lead to clear pleadings and streamlined issues if proceedings are commenced. 3. Letter of Claim 3.1. Before commencing proceedings, the claimant must send a letter of claim to the potential defendant. The letter of claim must be prepared in accordance with FORM 1 in this Protocol. 3.2. The letter of claim should be marked “Private and Confidential. To be opened by addressee only” and it should not be marked “without prejudice”. It must include the following information: 3.2.1. the name of the claimant; 3.2.2. sufficient details to identify the publication or broadcast which contained the words complained of; 3.2.3. the person(s) to whom the words complained of were published, broadcasted or spoken; 3.2.4. the exact words complained of and the date of publication or broadcast (if known), and where possible, a copy, screenshot or transcript of the words complained of should be enclosed; 3.2.5. if the words complained of are not in the English language, a translation of the words in the English language[^17]; 3.2.6. sufficient details of the factual inaccuracies or unsupportable comments within the words complained of to enable the potential defendant to appreciate why the words are inaccurate or unsupportable; 3.2.7. where relevant, any fact and matter which makes the claimant identifiable from the words complained of; 3.2.8. where relevant, details of any special fact relevant to the interpretation of the words complained of and the meanings which the claimant attributes to the words complained of; 3.2.9. where relevant, any particular damage caused by the words complained of; 3.2.10. the nature of the remedies sought by the claimant, for which purpose — (a) if the claimant is seeking monetary damages, he should indicate the quantum sought and as far as possible, refer to relevant case precedents and/or other authorities; and (b) if the claimant is seeking a retraction, clarification, apology and/or undertaking, he should enclose a draft for the potential defendant’s execution (a sample can be found at FORM 2 in this Protocol); 3.2.11. the timeframe given for the potential defendant to respond. Save in cases where there is exceptional urgency, the potential defendant should be given at least 14 days to respond. If a shorter timeframe is imposed, the claimant should explain the reasons for the urgency; and 3.2.12. a statement by the claimant as to which of the alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) options set out at paragraph 6 of this Protocol he proposes to use for the resolution of the dispute for the potential defendant to consider. 3.3. The letter of claim must be sent to the potential defendant by way of certificate of posting, registered post or any other mode which provides the claimant with a written acknowledgement of posting / delivery. 3.4. Nothing in this Protocol should be construed to operate as a stay of the time limited for the doing of any act as prescribed by the Limitation Act (Cap. 163). If, by reason of complying with any part of this Protocol, a claim may be time-barred under any provision of the Limitation Act, the claimant may commence proceedings without complying with this Protocol, or so much of this Protocol that he is unable to comply with by reason of the impending operation of an applicable limitation period. 4. Response to Letter of Claim 4.1. The potential defendant must provide a response to the claimant within 14 days of the receipt of the letter of claim (or such shorter time limit as specified in the letter of claim). The response must be in accordance with FORM 3 in this Protocol. 4.2. If the potential defendant is unable to respond substantively within 14 days (or such shorter time limit as specified), he must acknowledge receipt within the said 14 days (or shorter time limit) and inform the claimant of the length of time required to respond substantively to the claim. A sample acknowledgement can be found at FORM 4 in this Protocol. 4.3.

The above list is non-exhaustive and parties are free to consider and propose other ADR mechanisms to resolve the dispute. 6.3. If the claimant and the potential defendant are able to agree on a mode of ADR, the claimant should submit the relevant request for ADR (depending on chosen mode of ADR) within 14 days of the parties’ agreement to initiate the ADR process. 6.4. No party can be compelled to enter into any form of ADR. 7. Pre-Action Protocol Checklist 7.1.

"text": "9. Identification numbers to be stated in cause papers Parties named in the title of the documents (1) Where a party to any proceedings in the State Courts first files a document in such proceedings, he shall state his identification number, in parentheses, in the title of the document immediately below or after his name. Thereafter, all documents subsequently filed in the proceedings by any party shall include this identification number in the title of the documents in parentheses below or after the name of the party to which it applies. Parties not named in the title of the documents (2) Where a party to any proceedings in the State Courts first files a document in such proceedings, and the name of the party does not appear in the title of the document but does appear in the body of the document, then the identification number of the party should be stated, in parentheses, below or after the first appearance of his name in the document. Thereafter, all documents subsequently filed in the proceedings by any party shall include this identification number in parentheses immediately below or after the first appearance of the name of the party to which it applies in the subsequent document. Documents filed by two or more parties (3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall apply, with the necessary modifications, to documents which are filed by more than one party. Identification numbers for non-parties (4) If any person (living or dead), any entity or any property is in part or in whole the subject matter of any proceedings, or is affected by any proceedings, but is not a party thereto, and the name of such person, entity or property is to appear in the title of the documents filed in the proceedings, the party filing the first document in the proceedings must state the identification number of such person, entity or property in parentheses immediately below or after the name of the same. Thereafter, all documents subsequently filed in the proceedings by any party shall include this identification number in parentheses immediately below or after the name of the person, entity or property to which it applies. If the party filing the first document in the proceedings is unable, after reasonable enquiry, to discover the identification number of the person, entity or property, he may state immediately below or after the name of the same “(ID Unknown)”. All documents subsequently filed by any party shall then contain these words in parentheses below or after the name of this person, entity or property. Special cases (5) The following Directions shall apply in addition to the Directions contained in paragraphs (1) to (4): (a) where a party is represented by a litigation representative, paragraphs (1) to (3) shall apply to the litigation representative as if he were parties to the proceedings and the identification numbers of the party and the litigation representative must be stated below or after the name of each, as appropriate; (b) where parties are involved in any proceedings as the personal representatives of the estate of a deceased person, paragraphs (1) to (3) shall apply to the deceased person as if he were a party; and (c) where more than one identification number applies to any party, person, entity or property, all the identification numbers shall be stated in any convenient order. Identification numbers (6) When entering the identification number in the Electronic Filing Service, the full identification number should be entered, including any letters or characters that appear in, at the beginning of, or at the end of the number. Descriptive text which is required to be entered into the actual document, such as “Japanese Identification Card No.”, should not be entered into the electronic form. Guidelines for the selection of identification numbers (7) The following guidelines should be followed in deciding on the appropriate identification number. (a) Natural person with Singapore identity card For a natural person who is a Singapore citizen or permanent resident, the identification number shall be the number of the identity card issued under the National Registration Act (Cap. 201).  The 7 digit number as well as the letters at the front and end should be stated. For example: “(NRIC No. S1234567A)”. (b) Natural person with FIN number For a natural person, whether a Singapore citizen or permanent resident or not, who has not been issued with an identity card under the National Registration Act, but has been assigned a FIN number under the Immigration Regulations (Cap. 133, Rg 1), the identification number shall be the FIN number.  The number should be preceded by the prefix “FIN No.” (c) Natural person: birth certificate or passport number For a natural person, whether a Singapore citizen or permanent resident or not, who has not been issued with an identity card under the National Registration Act or assigned a FIN number, the identification number shall be the birth certificate or passport number.  The number should be preceded by either of the following, as appropriate, “(Issuing country) BC No.” or “(Issuing country) PP No.” (d) Natural person: other numbers For a natural person who is not a Singapore citizen or permanent resident and has not been assigned a FIN number and does not have a birth certificate or passport number, the identification number shall be the number of any identification document he may possess.  Both the number as well as some descriptive words which will enable the nature of the number given and the authority issuing the identification document to be ascertained, should be stated.  For example: “Japanese Identification Card No.” (e) Deceased person For a deceased natural person, the identification number shall be as set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) above.  However, if such numbers are not available, the identification number shall be the death registration number under the Registration of Births and Deaths Rules (Cap. 267, R 1) or the equivalent foreign provisions, where the death is registered abroad.  The number as well as the following words should be stated: “(Country or place of registration of death) Death Reg. No.” (f) Company registered under the Companies Act For a company registered under the Companies Act (Cap. 50), the identification number shall be the Unique Entity Number (UEN). (g) Company registered outside Singapore For a company registered outside Singapore which is not registered under the Companies Act, the identification number shall be the registration number of the company in the country of registration. (h) Business registered under the Business Names Registration Act For a body registered under the Business Names Registration Act (Cap. 32), the identification number shall be the UEN. (i) Limited Liability Partnership registered under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act For a limited liability partnership registered under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act (Cap. 163A), the identification number shall be the UEN. (j) Other bodies and associations For any other body or association, whether incorporated or otherwise, which does not fall within any of the descriptions in sub-paragraphs (f) to (i) above, the identification number shall be any unique number assigned to the body or association by any authority.  Both the number as well as some descriptive words which will enable the nature of the number given and the authority assigning the number to be ascertained, should be stated. For example: “Singapore Trade Union Reg. No. 123 A”. (k) No identification numbers exist Where the appropriate identification numbers referred to in sub-paragraphs (a) to (j) above do not exist in respect of any party, person, entity or property, the following words should be stated immediately below or after the name of that party, person, entity or property concerned: “(No ID No. exists)”. Inability to furnish identification number at the time of filing a document (8) If a party who wishes to file a document is unable at the time of filing to furnish the necessary identification numbers required by this Practice Direction, the party may indicate “(ID Unknown)” at the time of filing. However, when the necessary identification numbers have been obtained, the party must furnish the necessary identification numbers to the Registry through the Electronic Filing Service. Meaning of document (9) For avoidance of doubt, the words “document” and “documents” when used in this Practice Direction include all originating processes filed in the State Courts regardless of whether they are governed by the Rules of Court or not. Non-compliance (10) Any document which does not comply with this Practice Direction may be rejected for filing by the Registry."

"text": "11. Personal service of processes and documents (1) The attention of solicitors is drawn to Order 62, Rule 2(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5) which provides: “Personal service must be effected by a process server of the Court or by a solicitor or a solicitor’s clerk whose name and particulars have been notified to the Registrar for this purpose: Provided that the Registrar may, in a particular cause or matter, allow personal service to be effected by any other named person and shall, in that case, cause to be marked on the document required to be served personally, a memorandum to that effect.” (2) Solicitors must notify the Registry of the particulars of those clerks who have been authorised by them to serve processes and documents (hereafter referred to as “authorised process servers”) by submitting a request to authorise user through the Electronic Filing Service. (3) Where such authorised process servers are no longer so authorised, solicitors must revoke or delete the authorisation immediately by submitting a request through the Electronic Filing Service. Solicitors’ clerks do not require the authorisation of the Registrar to effect personal service of processes and documents. (4) In view of the alternative modes providing for personal service to be effected by a solicitor or a solicitor’s clerk, Court process servers will not be assigned to effect personal service of processes and documents unless there are special reasons.   (5) If it is felt that there are special reasons requiring personal service by a Court process server, a Request for such service must be filed through the Electronic Filing Service, setting out the special reasons.  The approval of the Duty Registrar must be obtained for such service. Once approval has been obtained, the documents for service must be presented at the counter designated for this purpose.  A process server will then be assigned to effect service and an appointment for service convenient to both the litigant and the assigned process server will be given. (6) On the appointed date, the person accompanying the process server must call at the Registry. The amount required for the transport charges of the process server (a record of which will be kept) must be tendered, or, alternatively, the process server in question must be informed that transport for him will be provided. The Registry will then instruct the process server to effect service. (7) Under no circumstances should any payment be made directly to the process server."

"text": "12. Substituted Service (1) In any application for substituted service, the applicant should persuade the Court that the proposed mode of substituted service will bring the document in question to the notice of the person to be served. (2) Two reasonable attempts at personal service should be made before an application for an order for substituted service is filed. In an application for substituted service, the applicant shall demonstrate by way of affidavit why he or she believes that the attempts at service made were reasonable. (3) The applicant should, where appropriate, also consider other modes of substituted service, such as AR registered post or electronic means (including electronic mail or Internet transmission) in addition to or in substitution of substituted service by posting on doors or gates of residential and business premises. (4) An application for substituted service by posting at an address or by AR registered post should contain evidence (for example, relevant search results from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, the Singapore Land Authority, the Housing &amp; Development Board or the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority) that the person to be served is either the owner of, resident or can be located at the property. (5) For the avoidance of doubt, substituted service by AR registered post is deemed to be effective when the postal service has delivered the document, or attempted to deliver the document (in cases where no one is present or willing to accept the document). (6) If substituted service is by electronic mail, it has to be shown that the electronic mail account to which the document will be sent belongs to the person to be served and that it is currently active. (7) An application for substituted service by advertisement (in one issue of the Straits Times if the person to be served is literate in English, or one issue of the Straits Times and one issue of one of the main non-English language newspapers where his language literacy is unknown) should only be considered as a last resort and should contain evidence that the person to be served is literate in the language of the newspaper in which the advertisement will be placed. (8) For the avoidance of doubt, posting on the Notice Board of the Registry of the State Courts is not available as a proposed mode of substituted service."

"title": "13. Amendment of documents",
"documentTitle": "State Courts Practice Directions 2014",
"url": "/PART-02-Originating-Processes-And-Documents.html#13-amendment-of-documents",
"text": "13. Amendment of documents General requirements for amendment of any document (1) Except as otherwise provided by the provisions of this Practice Direction, where any document (inclusive of any pleading) that has been filed in any proceedings is required to be amended and re-filed in Court, a fresh copy of the document with the amendments included must be prepared, regardless of the number and length of the amendments sought to be made. (2) The procedure for amending a document is as follows: (a) A fresh amended copy of the document should be produced. (b) The number of times the document has been amended shall be indicated in parentheses after the name of the document. For this purpose, an amended document should be entitled “[document name] (Amendment No. 1)” or “[document name] (Amendment No. 2)”, or as appropriate. For example, a Statement of Claim which is amended for the first time should be filed as “Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1)”, and a Defence that is amended for the second time should be filed as “Defence (Amendment No. 2)”. (c) The changes made in the document from the latest version of the document filed in Court should be indicated in the following way: (i) deletions shall be made by drawing a single line across the words to be deleted; and (ii) insertions shall be underlined. Colour scheme for amendments (3) In addition, the following colours shall be used to indicate the history of the amendments in the specified documents: (a) black for the first round of amendments; (b) red for the second round of amendments; (c) green for the third round of amendments; (d) blue for the fourth round of amendments; and (e) brown for subsequent rounds of amendments. Amendment for third time or more   (4) From the third round of amendments onwards, the amended specified document should comprise two versions of the document, i.e. — (a) a clean version without the amendments shown; followed in the same document by (b) a version showing the amendments in colour. (5) Only one amended document consisting of these two versions is required to be filed. Cases to which the requirements in paragraphs (1) and (2) do not apply (6) The directions in paragraph (2)(b) above shall not apply to any originating summons or summons that has been amended from an inter partes application to an ex parte application or vice versa. (7) The directions in paragraphs (2)(c) above shall not apply to any originating process, summons or other electronic form that is composed online through the Electronic Filing Service. Amendment endorsements on electronic forms (8) Order 20, Rule 10(2) of the Rules of Court requires that an amended pleading or other document be endorsed with a statement that it has been amended, specifying the date on which it was amended and by whom the order (if any) authorising the amendment was made and the date thereof, and if no such order was made, the number of the Rule in Order 20 of the Rules of Court in pursuance of which the amendment was made. (9) Where electronic forms are amended, the amendment endorsement shall take either one of the following forms: (a) “By order of court made on [date order was made]”; or (b) “Pursuant to Order 20, Rule [cite specific rule number]”. (10) The amendment endorsement shall be appended to the title of the electronic form, after the amendment number as required under paragraph (2)(b) above. Where an electronic form is amended more than once, the endorsement need only cite the basis for the most recent amendment. For example — (a) “Originating Summons (Amendment No. 3, by order of court made on 1 January 2013)”; (b) “Writ of Summons (Amendment No. 1, pursuant to O. 20, r 3)”. (11) The date of the electronic form shall reflect the date on which the document is amended. Amendments made on original writ or originating summons (where amendments are not numerous or lengthy) (12) This paragraph applies to writs and originating summonses that have not been filed using the Electronic Filing Service. In addition to the usual endorsement signed by the solicitors pursuant to Practice Direction 14 (Endorsements on originating processes and other documents), there should be re-sealing of the document as required by Order 20, Rule 10(1), of the Rules of Court. The seal will be embossed over the endorsement. Amendment of case title to add a party (13) Where leave of Court has been obtained to add a party to the main case title of a matter, for example, an intervener, a garnishee or any party that was previously a non-party, the applicant or his solicitor is to file a Request through the Electronic Filing Service to add that specific party to the main case title."

"text": "14. Endorsements on originating processes and other documents (1) The provisions of this Practice Direction shall apply where it is necessary to include endorsements on any document. (2) Endorsements are normally made on originating processes and other documents to show the renewal of, amendments to, and authorisation for service of, the document in question.  Such endorsements on originating processes and other documents do not require the Registrar’s signature.  This is because such endorsements are pursuant to either an order of Court or the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5).  The Registrar should therefore not be asked to sign such endorsements. (3) For documents that are filed through the Electronic Filing Service as electronic forms composed online, the following requirements apply: (a) Solicitors should select the appropriate endorsement and check the accuracy of the electronic form in the preview stage before filing the originating process or other document. The acceptance by the Registry of electronic forms composed online does not affect the regularity of any endorsements on the document. (b) Where endorsements can be made prior to the filing or issuance of a document, those endorsements shall be incorporated into the document before the document is filed or issued. (c) Where endorsements must be made on a document which has already been filed or issued, a fresh copy of the document containing the relevant endorsements shall be prepared, and the document must be re-filed or re-issued, as the case may be. An example of this would be renewals of writs of summons."

(3) To facilitate the contacting of lawyers having conduct of an action or charge of a matter by members of the staff of the State Courts, the following information shall be inserted on backing sheets of all cause papers and documents filed in the Registry in the format set out: “(Name of lawyer(s) having conduct of action or charge of matter.)

(3) All parties to a case shall have the liberty to make amendments at will to administrative details contained in the electronic case file through the Electronic Filing Service, and for this purpose — (a) administrative details include the contact details of solicitors, the identities of the solicitors, and the nature of the claim; and (b) where a party to a case is not a registered user of the Electronic Filing Service, he may attend at the service bureau to seek assistance to amend the administrative details contained in the electronic case file. (4) The Registry may require parties to a case to provide supporting documents to substantiate proposed amendments to other details of the electronic case file before the amendment is approved (e.g. amendments to add or remove a party to the case have to be supported by an order of court, and amendments to change the name, gender, identification number, or marital status of a party to the case have to be substantiated by documentary proof). File inspection by non-parties (5) In order to inspect a case file containing documents that were filed through the Electronic Filing Service, the following procedure should be followed: (a) A Request should be made to obtain leave to inspect the file, which request should — (i) be filed using the Electronic Filing Service; (ii) state the name of the person who is to carry out the search or inspection (and if this person is not a solicitor, his identity card number should also be included in the request, after his name); (iii) state the interest the applicant has in the matter, and the reason for the search or inspection; and (iv) if the search or inspection is requested for the purpose of ascertaining information for use in a separate suit or matter, clearly state the nature of the information sought and the relevance of such information to the separate suit or matter. (b) Once approval for inspection has been received from the Court: (i) Registered users can inspect the case file online through the Electronic Filing Service; (ii) Parties who are not registered users can inspect the case file by presenting a copy of the approval at the service bureau. After verifying the approval that has been presented, the service bureau will assign a personal computer to the inspecting party for the inspection to be carried out. An inspecting party will usually be allowed only 60 minutes to carry out the inspection. If a longer period is required, the service bureau may impose a charge for use of the computer. The service bureau may impose additional charges for downloading soft copies or printing hard copies of documents from the case file being inspected. (6) Requests in hard copy may be submitted to inspect case files containing documents which were not filed using the Electronic Filing Service. The Registry will only accept requests which are printed or typewritten on paper of good quality and signed by the solicitors concerned. Requests which have any erasure marks on them will be rejected. Requests which are double stamped, that is, if the requests were originally short stamped and later stamped to add up to the correct fee, may be rejected. (7) Solicitors must communicate to the Registrar in writing the names of their clerks who have their authority to make searches and inspections. Such authority may be in respect of a specific search or inspection or for a specified period. (8) For the avoidance of doubt, a non-party who has obtained approval to inspect a case file may take and retain a soft copy of any document that is available for inspection. All copies of documents taken in the course of inspection should not be used for purposes other than those stated in the Request to inspect. Solicitors shall be responsible for informing their clients of this. Obtaining certified true copies of documents (9) Users are encouraged to use the Authentic Court Order system to validate orders of court issued after 2 January 2020 by going to https://www.courtorders.gov.sg. However, certified true copies of orders of court will still be available upon application. Applications to obtain certified true paper copies of documents should be made by way of filing a Request through the Electronic Filing Service, unless the documents concerned have not been filed through the Electronic Filing Service. (9A) Applications to obtain hard copy extracts or certified true copies of documents in civil proceedings that do not use the Electronic Filing Service may be made by submitting a Request to the Registry: (a) The intended use of the hard copy extracts or certified true copies should be clearly stated in the Request. The relevance and necessity of the hard copy extracts or certified true copies in relation to their intended use should also be clearly described. (b) The applicant will be informed of the outcome to his or her Request and the fees payable for the provision of the certified true copies if the Request is approved. Upon confirmation of the receipt of payment of the fees payable, the certified true copies will be released to the applicant. The Registry may require verification of the identity of the applicant against his or her identification document (including physical or digital identity card) prior to release of the certified true copies. (c) The fees prescribed by Appendix B to the Rules of Court will be payable for the provision of the above service. (10) The intended use of the certified true copies should be clearly stated in the Request. The relevance and necessity of the certified true copies in relation to their intended use should also be clearly described. (11) Once approval is received from the Court, the applicant should present a printed copy of the approved Request at the Central Registry. After verifying that the Request presented has been approved, the staff of the Central Registry will inform the applicant of any additional fees payable and the manner in which payment is to be made. (12) The fees prescribed by Appendix B to the Rules of Court will be payable for the above services without prejudice to additional printing charges which may be chargeable by the Court or the service bureau for reproducing the copies in paper form. Electronic cause books and registers maintained by the Registry (13) Order 60 Rule 2 of the Rules of Court provides that the Registry shall maintain information prescribed or required to be kept by the Rules of Court and Practice Directions issued by the Registrar. In addition to any provisions in the Rules of Court, the Registrar hereby directs that the following information shall be maintained by the Registry: (a) details of all originating processes, including: (i) details of interlocutory applications; (ii) details of appeals filed therein; and (iii) details of probate proceedings, including wills and caveats filed therein; (b) details of writs of execution, writs of distress and orders of arrest; and (c) any other information as may from time to time be deemed necessary. (14) Searches of this information under Order 60 Rule 3 of the Rules of Court may be conducted through the Electronic Filing Service at a service bureau or at the Records Section. The fees prescribed by Appendix B to the Rules of Court will be payable for the searches.   (15) An application may be made by any person for a licence to use any information contained in any electronic cause book or register subject to such terms and conditions as the Registrar may determine. Successful applicants will be required to enter into separate technical services agreements with the Electronic Filing Service provider. Applications under this Practice Direction must be made in writing, identifying the data fields sought and providing details of how the information will be used."

"text": "18. Overview of the simplified process (1) The Practice Directions in this Part, unless otherwise stated, apply to — (a) all civil proceedings begun on or after 1st November 2014 by writ which are before a Magistrate’s Court; and (b) any civil proceedings begun on or after 1st November 2014 by writ — (i) which are before a District Court; and (ii) in which the parties thereto have, pursuant to Order 108, Rule 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5), consented to the application of Order 108 to those proceedings by filing their consent in Form 233 of Appendix A of the Rules of Court. (2) The simplified process provided for by Order 108 is meant to facilitate the fair, expedient and inexpensive determination of all such proceedings in a manner which is proportionate to – (a) the amount of the claim; (b) the number of parties; (c) the complexity of the issues; (d) the amount of costs that is likely to be incurred by each party; and (e) the nature of the action. (3) An important feature of the simplified process is the upfront discovery under Order 108, Rule 2, which requires parties to serve a list of documents together with their pleadings, to allow the parties to have the fullest possible particulars of each other’s case in order to facilitate effective negotiations towards an early resolution of the dispute between the parties without a trial. (4) The Case Management Conference (CMC) provided for by Order 108, Rule 3 will be central to the simplified process. At the CMC, the Court will endeavour to assist the parties in narrowing the issues between them, managing any interlocutory matters and facilitating an early resolution of the dispute. (5) The CMC will not apply to non-injury motor accident [NIMA] claims and personal injury [PI] claims, including any action where the pleadings contain an allegation of a negligent act or omission in the course of medical or dental treatment. In this regard, Practice Direction 20 (Case management conference [CMC]) does not apply to NIMA and PI claims. Such claims will be dealt with following the pre-action protocols and practice directions issued by Registrar. Please refer to Practice Directions 35, 37, 38 and 39 for more information. (6) Where a case cannot be resolved amicably, the Court will give directions for a simplified trial unless the circumstances warrant otherwise."

"text": "19. Upfront discovery (1) Prior to the service of the pleading on the other party, a party shall file a list of documents using Form 234 of Appendix A of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5). Order 108 Rule 2(4) of the Rules of Court states that: “The list of documents referred to in paragraph (3) — (a) must be filed in Form 234; (b) must set out — (i) every document referred to in the pleading which the list accompanies; (ii) every document on which the party serving the list relies or will rely; and (iii) any other document which could — (A) adversely affect that party’s own case; (B) adversely affect another party’s case; or (C) support another party’s case; and (c) must set out the documents in a convenient order and as shortly as possible, but also describe each document sufficiently to enable the document to be identified.” (2) Every pleading served by a party shall be accompanied by a list of documents (filed separately from the pleading) using Form 234 as set out in Order 108, Rule 2(4) of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5). The list of documents filed shall be served together with the relevant pleading on the other party within the time limited for the service of such pleading. (3) For the avoidance of doubt, in any case where further and better particulars of a pleading are filed which refer to or plead new documents, the party shall file a supplementary list of documents. (4) A request by a party for a copy of any document on the other party’s list of documents shall be made in writing in accordance with Order 108, Rule 2(5). The party served with such a request for documents shall provide the documents within 7 days of the request. (5) Where an applicant for an order under Order 108, Rule 2(9) for the discovery or production of documents did not make a prior request by letter for the documents he requires, the Court may refuse to make the order unless the applicant shows sufficient reasons for not making the prior request by letter."

"text": "20. Case management conference [CMC] (1) The provisions of this Practice Direction apply to all cases begun on or after 1 November 2014 by writ in a Magistrate’s Court, except the following: (a) any non-injury motor accident (NIMA) claims; and (b) any personal injury (PI) claims (including any action where the pleadings contain an allegation of a negligent act or omission in the course of medical or dental treatment). (2) In accordance with Order 108 Rule 3(8) of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5), the cases referred to in paragraph (1)(a) and (b) will be dealt with following the pre-action protocols and practice directions issued by Registrar. Please refer to Practice Directions 35, 37, 38 and 39 for more information. (3) To facilitate the management of cases at an early stage and to encourage parties to consider how a case may be resolved without trial (including through the use of negotiation, the Court Dispute Resolution (CDR) process or any appropriate Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process), a case management conference (CMC) as provided for by Order 108, Rule 3(1) shall be convened within 50 days after the Defence has been filed. (4) Parties shall be notified in writing of the CMC within 8 days of the filing of the Defence. (5) Where all parties in a case begun on or after 1 November 2014 by writ in a District Court file their consent in Form 233 of Appendix A of the Rules of Court for the simplified process in Order 108 to apply to their case, the parties shall file a Request via the Electronic Filing Service for a Case Management Conference to be convened. Before the CMC (6) The parties should negotiate with a view to resolving the matter at the earliest opportunity once they are notified of the CMC date. (7) Seven (7) days prior to the first CMC, the parties shall (a) exchange proposals in writing using Form 2 of Appendix A to these Practice Directions, on a “without prejudice save as to costs” basis for the amicable resolution of the matter; and (b) file through the Electronic Filing Service — (i) Form 3 of Appendix A to these Practice Directions stating the list of issues in the dispute and the list of witnesses they intend to call in support of their case; and (ii) the CDR/ADR Form (Form 7 of Appendix A to these Practice Directions) in order to facilitate a considered decision on the appropriate CDR/ADR options. The CDR/ADR Form must be read and completed by each party. If there is a solicitor acting for the party, the solicitor must also complete the Form. (8) In order for the CMC to be effective and fruitful, the solicitor having conduct of the matter should take all necessary instructions from their clients to achieve an amicable resolution of the matter (including exploring the use of any appropriate CDR or ADR process), and comply with all directions (including those at paragraph (7) above), prior to attending the first CMC session. (9) The CDR/ADR processes available include: (a) Mediation by the State Courts’ Court Dispute Resolution Cluster (CDRC); (b) Conciliation by the CDRC; (c) Neutral Evaluation by the CDRC; (d) Court Dispute Resolution process by the CDRC under Practice Direction 39A for all claims in negligence; (e) Arbitration under the Law Society’s Arbitration Scheme; or (f) Mediation by private mediation service providers. (10) A party may file a Request via the Electronic Filing Service for an early CMC date prior to receiving the CMC notification mentioned in paragraph (4). All parties shall comply with paragraphs (6) and (7) before the CMC. At the CMC (11) At the CMC, the Court may manage the case by, inter alia, — (a) encouraging the parties to co-operate in the conduct of the proceedings; (b) assisting parties to identify and narrow the issues at an early stage; (c) dealing with any interlocutory applications and issues, including giving such directions for discovery as may be necessary; (d) considering with the parties whether the likely benefits of any step proposed to be taken by a party would justify the costs that will be incurred; (e) encouraging the parties to negotiate to resolve the issues and/or case, and/or to undergo the appropriate CDR or ADR process, as well as facilitating the use of such CDR or ADR process having regard to Order 108, Rule 3(3) of the Rules of Court; (f) helping the parties to settle the whole or part of the case; (g) giving such directions as the Court thinks fit in order to ensure that the case progresses expeditiously (including directions for the list of witnesses to be called for trial, the appointment of a single joint expert where appropriate, the exchange and filing of Affidavits of Evidence in Chief and setting the matter down for trial); (h) fixing timelines to manage and control the progress of the case; and (i) taking such other action or making such other direction as the Court thinks appropriate in the circumstances including costs sanctions or unless orders. (12) The purpose of the CMC is for the court to consider all available options in the case jointly with the parties. It is therefore necessary that the solicitor in charge of the case for that party (i.e. the solicitor who has been handling the case for that party and who is familiar with it) attend the CMC. Solicitors for both parties shall attend the CMC. (13) The Court may require a party who is represented by solicitors to attend the CMC. (14) Where a party has filed a Summons for Direction (SFD), the Court may also deal with the SFD at the CMC. (15) In order that parties benefit fully from the process of the CMC, adjournment(s) of any CMC will not be granted without good reason. Consent of both parties to the adjournment, without more, is not considered sufficient reason for an adjournment. (16) Where interlocutory judgment has been entered on the issue of liability only, leaving the damages to be assessed, the Court shall convene a case management conference after the filing of the Notice of Appointment for Assessment of Damages (NAAD). Such a case management conference shall be known as the Assessment of Damages Case Management Conference (AD-CMC). Paragraphs (10) to (15) above shall apply as far as possible with the necessary modifications to ensure that the matter progresses expeditiously. Where an amicable resolution on quantum is not possible, the assessment of damages hearing will proceed expeditiously. The provisions of Practice Direction 40 (Assessment of damages) on assessment of damages shall continue to apply. The CDR/ADR Form (Form 7 of Appendix A to these Practice Directions) is not required to be filed prior to the AD-CMC."

"text": "22A. “Documents-Only” Civil Trials and Assessments of Damages (1) This Practice Direction applies when parties elect to apply for a “Documents-Only” Civil Trial or Assessment of Damages (“Assessment”). (2) Essentially, “Documents-Only” Civil Trials and Assessments are hearings in which the final determination of the case will be conducted entirely on the basis of — (a) evidence tendered by way of Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEICs”); and/or (b) documents and/or written submissions. (3) Where the option of “Documents-Only” Civil Trials and Assessments is requested by parties and approved by the Courts pursuant to the procedures below, except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Practice Direction, all pre-trial processes/applications and appeal processes/applications available to parties in their relevant Suit as stated under the Rules of Courts (Cap. 322, R 5) and these Practice Directions will continue to apply to the relevant proceedings. (4) The types of cases that are designated as suitable for “Documents-Only” Civil Trials or Assessments and the additional steps and procedures that will apply for such cases are set out below. Designated cases (5) The following Magistrate’s Court and District Court cases are designated as suitable for “Documents-Only” Civil Trials or Assessments: (a) cases where the issues in dispute centre on the interpretation of documents; (b) cases where the cross-examination of witnesses is not necessary either because there are no disputes of fact, and/or the parties agree to admit Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief without the attendance of the witnesses (e.g. due to the simplicity of issues in dispute, the small value of the claim, or any other valid reason); (c) cases where the Court may determine the dispute based on the existing contemporaneous documents without the testimony of witnesses; (d) cases where the cross-examination of witnesses is not an option for the dispute in question (i.e. where the relevant witnesses are not willing and/or available to give evidence, for example, where an ex-employee is no longer with the relevant company, a third party witness refuses to provide evidence or attend court, or a witness can no longer be located or is ill or has died); and/or (e) cases where the issues between parties can be determined entirely by legal submissions/arguments. Consideration of the suitability of a “Documents-Only” Civil Trial or Assessment of Damages (6) Counsel should consider the suitability of their case for a “Documents-Only” Civil Trial or Assessment and obtain their respective clients’ instructions prior to attending the following sessions: (a) in the case of Magistrates’ Courts cases to which Order 108 of the Rules of Court applies, the first Case Management Conference (“CMC”); (b) in the case of all other civil matters, the first Pre-Trial Conference (“PTC”) convened under Order 34A of the Rules of Court after setting down; or (c) in the case of civil matters in the Assessment of Damages phase of proceedings, the first Assessment of Damages Court Dispute Resolution Conference (“ADCDR”), Pre-Trial Conference for Assessment of Damages (“AD-PTC”) and/or Case Management Conference for Assessment of Damages (“AD-CMC”) convened after the filing of the Notice of Appointment for Assessment of Damages. (7) The CMC/PTC/ADCDR/AD-PTC/AD-CMC judicial officer will discuss with parties the suitability of the case for a “Documents-Only” Civil Trial or Assessment. (8) Where parties agree to a “Documents-Only” Civil Trial or Assessment, they must personally execute and file the Request Form set out in Form 4C (Request for the Conduct of Documents-Only Trial) in Appendix A to these Practice Directions. Any Request Form that is executed by the solicitors on behalf of their clients will not be accepted. (9) In every case, a “Documents-Only” Civil Trial or Assessment will only be ordered if — (a) all parties consent to the adoption of this mode of conduct of the Civil Trial or Assessment; (b) all parties personally execute and file the Request Forms recording their consent; and (c) the CMC/PTC/ADCDR/AD-PTC/AD-CMC judicial officer deems the case to be suitable for a “Documents-Only” Civil Trial or Assessment. (10) Where requested by the parties, a hearing date will be fixed for them to make oral submissions in support of their respective cases before a decision is delivered. This request for a hearing date can be made in the Request Form. In the case of Trials, such submissions will be made in Open Court before the Trial Judge and in the case of Assessments, such submissions will be made in Chambers before the judicial officer hearing the Assessment. Additional directions for a “Documents-Only” Civil Trial or Assessment (11) Where parties agree to a “Documents-Only” Civil Trial or Assessment, except as specifically provided herein, there are no changes to the pre-trial or pre-assessment applications and/or processes which may be undertaken by parties as provided for under the Rules of Court or Practice Directions until — (a) the PTC convened after setting down; and/or (b) the ADCDR, AD-PTC and AD-CMC convened after parties have filed their Notice of Appointment for the Assessment for Damages. (12) At the PTC convened after setting down, in addition to the usual directions given to parties for the filing of bundles, directions will be given for parties to file their respective written submissions and Bundles of Authorities. Where requested by the parties, a half-day hearing slot will also be given for them to make any oral submissions they wish to before the Trial Judge in Open Court. (13) At the ADCDR, AD-CMC and/or AD-PTC, in addition to the usual directions given to parties for the filing of bundles, directions will be given for parties to file their respective written submissions and Bundles of Authorities. Where requested by the parties, a half-day hearing slot will also be given for parties to make any oral submissions they wish to before the judicial officer hearing the Assessment in Chambers. (14) In certain cases, where necessary, the Trial Judge or the judicial officer hearing the Assessment may issue further directions for the fair and effective conduct of the Civil Trial or Assessment, including directions for the following matters: (a) that a further PTC be convened for counsel to address the Court on certain issues; (b) that further submissions and/or authorities be submitted by counsel/parties in writing or in person; (c) that the Civil Trial or Assessment not be conducted on a documents-only basis as it appears on a review of the documents submitted that certain factual or expert witnesses will need to be called; and/or (d) any other matter that the Trial Judge or the judicial officer hearing the Assessment thinks necessary to be dealt with. (15) When the Trial Judge or the judicial officer hearing the Assessment is ready to deliver judgment, a Registrar’s Notice will be issued informing parties to appear in Court to receive the judgment. For Civil Trials, judgments will be delivered in Open Court and for Assessments, judgments will be delivered in Chambers. (16) After a decision is delivered in a Civil Trial or Assessment conducted on a “Documents-Only” basis, all appeal processes applicable to the relevant matter will apply as provided for under the Rules of Courts and these Practice Directions."

"text": "24A. Filing of Distinct Applications in Separate Summonses (1) A party who intends to make more than one distinct substantive application in a cause or matter must file each application in a separate summons. (2) Distinct applications should not be combined in a single summons, unless they are inextricably or closely linked, or involve overlapping or substantially similar issues (for example, where applications for the extension or abridgment of time, the amendment of pleadings and costs are closely linked to some other more substantive application). (3) In addition, applications should not contain alternative prayers when the alternative prayers sought in effect amount to distinct applications. For example, a party should not make an application for further and better particulars on particular issues, and in the alternative, interrogatories on different issues. In such a case, separate summonses should be filed. In contrast, the following is an example of an alternative prayer which may be permitted: In the defendant’s summons setting out a prayer for the striking out of certain paragraphs of the Statement of Claim, the defendant also includes an alternative prayer for the plaintiff to be ordered to amend those paragraphs of the Statement of Claim. (4) Any summons that is not in compliance with this Practice Direction may be rejected by the Registry of the State Courts.

Summonses for Directions Cases that are subject to the simplified process under Order 108 of the Rules of Court (Magistrate’s Court cases filed on or after 1st November 2014 and by consent, District Court cases filed on or after 1st November 2014) (1) Under Order 108 of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5) and Practice Direction 20 (Case management conference [CMC]), a case commenced by writ on or after 1st November 2014 in a Magistrate’s Court, and by consent, a case commenced by writ on or after 1st November 2014 in a District Court, will be called for a case management conference within 50 days after the Defence has been filed. The case management conference is convened to facilitate the management of the case from an early stage and to encourage parties to consider how the case may be resolved without trial, through negotiation or any Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process including mediation, neutral evaluation or arbitration. A summons for directions need not be filed in such cases, as the necessary directions will be given at the case management conference. Cases that are not subject to the simplified process under Order 108 of the Rules of Court: Application of presumption of ADR (2) Order 25, Rule 1(1)(b), of the Rules of Court provides that directions may be given at the Summons For Direction (SFD) hearing for the just, expeditious and economical disposal of the case. At the SFD hearing, solicitors should be ready to consider all available ADR options, including mediation and arbitration, for the most effective resolution of the case. The Court will refer cases for ADR during the SFD hearing, and/or make any other directions for the purpose of case management. (3) The Deputy Registrar may recommend the appropriate mode of dispute resolution at the SFD hearing. To facilitate a considered decision on the ADR options, the ADR Form (Form 7 of Appendix A to these Practice Directions) must be read and completed by the solicitors for all parties and their clients when taking out or responding to an SFD application. A party who is not represented shall also complete the relevant sections of the ADR Form. (4) When filing the SFD, the plaintiff must file the ADR Form through the Electronic Filing Service (EFS) under the document name “Incoming Correspondence – ADR Form (Plaintiff)”. The defendant must file the ADR Form not less than 7 days before the hearing date for the SFD. This Form shall be filed under the document name “Incoming Correspondence – ADR Form (Defendant)” through the EFS. No court fees will be charged for the filing of the ADR Form. (5) This requirement does not apply to — (a) motor accident claims; (b) personal injury claims other than claims in medical negligence; or (c) any case which has gone through Court Dispute Resolution before the SFD is filed. (6) The solicitors for all the parties shall be present at the SFD hearing. (7) All cases shall be automatically referred by the Court for the most appropriate mode of ADR during the SFD hearing, unless any or all of the parties opt out of ADR. A party who wishes to opt out of ADR should indicate his/her decision in the ADR Form. Where the Judge is of the view that ADR is suitable, and the party/parties have opted out of ADR for unsatisfactory reasons, this conduct may be taken into account by the Court when making subsequent costs orders pursuant to Order 59 Rule 5(1)(c) of the Rules of Court, which states: “The Court in exercising its discretion as to costs shall, to such extent, if any, as may be appropriate in the circumstances, take into account the parties’ conduct in relation to any attempt at resolving the cause or matter by mediation or any other means of dispute resolution.” (8) The Deputy Registrar hearing the SFD may make recommendations to the parties for the matter to proceed for — (a) Mediation by the State Courts’ Court Dispute Resolution Cluster (CDRC); (b) Conciliation by the CDRC; (c) Neutral Evaluation by the CDRC; (d) Arbitration under the Law Society’s Arbitration Scheme; or (e) Mediation by private mediation service providers."

"text": "29. Ex parte applications for injunctions (1) Order 29, Rule 1, of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5) provides that an application for the grant of an injunction may be made ex parte in cases of urgency.  However, the cases of Castle Fitness Consultancy Pte Ltd v Manz [1989] SLR 896 and ‘The Nagasaki Spirit’ (No.1) [1994] 1 SLR 434 take the position that an opponent to an ex parte application, especially where the application seeks injunctive relief, should be invited to attend at the hearing of the application. (2) In view of this, any party applying ex parte for an injunction (including a Mareva injunction) must give notice of the application to the other concerned parties prior to the hearing.  The notice may be given by way of facsimile transmission or the use of any other electronic means (including electronic mail or Internet transmission), or, in cases of extreme urgency, orally by telephone. Except in cases of extreme urgency or with the leave of the Court, the party shall give a minimum of two hours’ notice to the other parties before the hearing. The notice should inform the other parties of the date, time and place fixed for the hearing of the application and of the nature of the relief sought.  If possible, a copy of the originating process, the ex parte summons and supporting affidavit(s) should be given to each of the other parties in draft form as soon as they are ready to be filed in Court.  At the hearing of the ex parte application, in the event that some or all of the other parties are not present or represented, the applicant’s solicitors should inform the Court of: (a) the attempts that were made to notify the other parties or their solicitors of the making of the application; (b) what documents were given to the other parties or their solicitors and when these documents were given; and (c) whether the other parties or their solicitors consent to the application being heard without their presence. (3) The Directions set out in paragraph (2) need not be followed if the giving of the notice to the other parties, or some of them, would or might defeat the purpose of the ex parte application.  However, in such cases, the reasons for not following the Directions should be clearly set out in the affidavit prepared in support of the ex parte application."

"text": "30. Mareva injunctions and search orders (1) Applicants for Mareva injunctions and search orders are required to prepare their orders in accordance with the following Forms in Appendix A to these Practice Directions: (a) Form 5: Search order; (b) Form 6A: Worldwide Mareva injunction; and (c) Form 6B: Mareva injunction limited to assets within the jurisdiction. (2) These Forms, inevitably, are complicated, but their language and layout are intended to make it easier for persons served with these orders to understand what they mean.  These standard form orders should be used save to the extent that the Judge hearing a particular application considers there is a good reason for adopting a different Form.  Any departure from the terms of the prescribed Forms should be justified by the applicant in his supporting affidavit(s). (3) The applicant should undertake not to inform any third party of the proceedings until after the return date. (4) Wherever practicable, applications should be made sufficiently early so as to ensure that the Judge has sufficient time to read and consider the application in advance. (5) On an ex parte application for a Mareva injunction or a search order, an applicant may be required, in an appropriate case, to support his cross-undertaking in damages by a payment to be made into Court, a bond to be issued by an insurance company with a place of business within Singapore, a written guarantee to be issued from a bank with a place of business within Singapore or a payment to the applicant’s solicitor to be held by the solicitor as an officer of the Court pending further order. Applications for search orders (6) It was suggested in Universal Thermosensors Ltd v Hibben [1992] 3 All ER 257 at 276 that the order be served by a supervising solicitor and carried out in his presence and under his supervision.  The supervising solicitor should be an experienced solicitor who is not a member or employee of the firm acting for the applicant and who has some familiarity with the operation of search orders.  The evidence in support of the application should include the identity and experience of the proposed supervising solicitor.  These guidelines are equally applicable in the local context and the Judge in his discretion may, in appropriate cases, require a supervising solicitor. (7) Where the premises are likely to be occupied by an unaccompanied woman, at least one of the persons attending on the service of the order should be a woman. (8) Where the nature of the items removed under the order makes this appropriate, the applicant will be required to insure them."

"text": "35. Overview of the Court Dispute Resolution (CDR) process for civil cases (1) This Part of the Practice Directions focuses on the CDR process for civil disputes only. (2) The CDR process and other appropriate Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) processes should be considered at the earliest possible stage. The judge-driven CDR process gives the parties the opportunity to resolve their disputes faster and more economically compared to determination at trial. Mediation, conciliation and neutral evaluation are undertaken as part of the CDR process and, subject to the exception stated in paragraph (7), are provided by the Court without additional charges imposed. CDR sessions are — (a) a type of pre-trial conferences convened under Order 34A of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322 R 5), which empowers the Court to convene pre-trial conferences for the purpose of the “just, expeditious and economical disposal of the cause or matter”; or (b) conducted pursuant to a referral under Order 108 Rule 3 of the Rules of Court. (3) Aside from the CDR process undertaken by the Courts, the Courts also encourage parties to consider using other ADR processes, including the following: (a) Mediation at the Singapore Mediation Centre or Singapore International Mediation Centre; (b) Mediation under the Law Society Mediation Scheme and/or Arbitration under the Law Society Arbitration Scheme; and (c) Mediation and/or Arbitration by private service providers. The Court Dispute Resolution process (4) The CDR process pursuant to Order 34A of the Rules of Court is overseen by the State Courts’ Court Dispute Resolution Cluster (CDRC). During the CDR process, the following dispute resolution mechanisms can be used, namely — (a) Mediation; (b) Conciliation; and (c) Neutral Evaluation. (Solicitors may refer to the Singapore Courts website at https://www.judiciary.gov.sg for more information on these mechanisms.) Confidentiality (5) Pursuant to Order 34A Rule 7 of the Rules of Court, no communication made in the course of a CDR session shall be disclosed to the Court conducting the trial of the action or proceedings if such communication has been stated by any of the parties to be confidential or without prejudice, or has been marked by the Judge at the CDR session as being confidential or without prejudice. For the avoidance of doubt, all communications made in the course of a CDR session shall be marked by the Judge as being confidential or without prejudice, save for the following: (a) directions given by the Judge for the purpose of case management (including directions for the filing of pleadings, discovery, exchange of affidavits of evidence in chief, setting down for trial and filing of notice of discontinuance); (b) terms of settlement (unless expressly agreed by all the parties to the settlement as being confidential), consent judgments and consent orders of court. (6) If the parties are unable to resolve their dispute during the CDR process, the Judge will give the necessary directions for the action to proceed to trial at the CDR session. The action will be tried by another Judge other than the Judge conducting the CDR session. Fees (7) Hearing fees are not imposed for the CDR process carried out by the CDRC, with the following exception set out in Order 90A Rule 5A of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322 R 5): “(1) Subject to this Rule, a fee of $250 is payable by each party in a case in a District Court (regardless of whether the case is commenced before, on or after 1 May 2015) for all Court ADR services that are provided in the case. (2) The Court ADR fee is payable when the first Court ADR service to be provided in the case, pursuant to either of the following, is fixed (a) a request made on or after 1 May 2015 for the Court ADR service by any party in the case; (b) a referral on or after 1 May 2015 by the Court or the Registrar (3) No Court ADR fee is payable in any of the following actions: (a) any non-injury motor accident action (as defined in Order 59 Appendix 2 Part V); (b) any action for damages for death or personal injuries; (c) any action under the Protection from Harassment Act 2014 (Act 17 of 2014). (4) The Registrar may, in any case, waive or defer the payment of the whole or any part of the Court ADR fee on such terms and conditions as the Registrar deems fit.” (8) Each party who has requested the CDR process or has been referred for the CDR process pursuant to Order 90A Rule 5A of the Rules of Court shall pay the fee of $250 before proceeding for the scheduled CDR session. Details concerning the payment of these fees are provided in the relevant correspondence by the State Courts to the parties. Presumption of ADR for all cases (9) A “presumption of Alternative Dispute Resolution” applies to all civil cases. For this purpose, the Court — (a) encourages parties to consider the appropriate CDR or ADR processes as a “first stop” for resolving the dispute, at the earliest possible stage; and (b) will, as a matter of course, refer appropriate matters to the appropriate CDR or ADR process. Presumption of CDR for non-injury motor accident (NIMA) claims, personal injury claims, medical negligence claims and claims in negligence (10) The CDR process will be used for the following cases: (a) all non-injury motor accident (NIMA), personal injury cases and actions arising out of an alleged negligent act or omission in the course of medical or dental treatment (“medical negligence claims”) that are filed in the Magistrate’s Court and the District Court; (b) all motor accident cases (whether or not involving any claim for personal injuries) and actions for personal injuries arising out of an industrial accident that are commenced in the High Court on or after 1 December 2016 and transferred to the District Court (references to NIMA and personal injury cases would hereinafter include these cases); and (c) all claims in negligence, including professional negligence claims that are filed in the District Court. (11) The Court will send a notice to the solicitors fixing the date of the first CDR session within 8 weeks of the filing of the memorandum of appearance. (12) The procedure and protocols set out in Practice Directions 37 (Non-injury Motor Accident (NIMA) Claims) and 38 (Personal Injury Claims) shall apply, as appropriate, to NIMA and personal injury claims, respectively. (13) The procedure and protocols set out in Practice Direction 39 (Medical Negligence Claims) shall apply, as appropriate, to medical negligence claims. (14) The procedure set out in Practice Direction 39A (Claims in Negligence (Excluding Medical Negligence, Personal Injury and Non-Injury Motor Accident (NIMA) Claims)) shall apply, as appropriate, to claims in negligence, including professional negligence claims. Presumption of CDR/ADR for other cases (excluding NIMA, personal injury, medical negligence cases and claims in negligence): A. Cases that are subject to the simplified process under Order 108 of the Rules of Court (i.e. Magistrate’s Court cases filed on or after 1 November 2014 and, by consent, District Court cases filed on or after 1 November 2014) (15) All cases commenced by writ on or after 1 November 2014 in a Magistrate’s Court and any case commenced by writ on or after 1 November 2014 in a District Court (where parties have filed their consent in Form 233 of Appendix A of the Rules of Court for Order 108 to apply) will be subject to the simplified process under Order 108 of the Rules of Court. (16) The Court will convene a case management conference within 50 days of the filing of the Defence pursuant to Order 108 Rule 3 of the Rules of Court. At the case management conference, the Court may refer cases to undergo the appropriate CDR or ADR process, where — (a) the parties consent to the case being referred for resolution by the CDR or ADR process; or (b) the Court is of the view that doing so would facilitate the resolution of the dispute between the parties. (17) Practice Direction 20 (Case management conference (CMC)) sets out details of the case management conference. B. Cases that are not subject to the simplified process (18) In all other cases commenced in a Magistrate’s Court before 1 November 2014, and all cases commenced in a District Court on or after 1 April 2014, the Court will fix a Pre-Trial Conference (PTC) within 4 months after the filing of the writ if — (a) the Defence has been filed; (b) no summons for directions or application for summary judgment, striking out, stay, transfer or consolidation of proceedings has been taken out for the case; and (c) no CDR session has been fixed. (19) Such cases shall be automatically referred by the Court to undergo the appropriate CDR or ADR process during the PTC, unless the parties opt out of the CDR or ADR process. (20) The procedure for referral to the appropriate CDR or ADR process is set out in Practice Direction 36 (Mode of referral to CDR/ADR etc.). (21) Parties who wish to undergo the CDR process at an earlier stage must file a “Request for CDR” via the Electronic Filing Service. The “Request for CDR” is set out in Form 7A in Appendix A to these Practice Directions. (22) Parties are not required to file a “Request for CDR” in the following cases: (a) all NIMA, personal injury, medical negligence claims and claims in negligence, including professional negligence claims, as the parties are automatically notified by the Court to attend CDR sessions; (b) all cases commenced by writ before 1 November 2014 in a Magistrate’s Court, and all cases commenced in a District Court, as the Court will refer the appropriate cases to undergo the CDR process during PTCs or summonses for directions; and (c) all cases commenced by writ on or after 1 November 2014 in a Magistrate’s Court which are subject to the simplified process in Order 108 (excluding NIMA, personal injury and medical negligence claims), as the Court will deal with matters concerning CDR/ADR at the case management conference. (Further details are set out in Part III of these Practice Directions and in Practice Direction 39A in relation to claims in negligence, including professional negligence claims.) Request for adjournment of CDR session (23) A dedicated time slot is set aside for each CDR session. In order to minimise wastage of time and resources, any request for adjournment of a CDR session shall be made early. A request to adjourn a CDR session — (a) for NIMA, personal injury claims and claims in negligence shall be made not less than 2 working days before the date of the CDR session; and (b) for all other cases shall be made not less than 7 working days before the date of the CDR session. (24) A request for an adjournment of a CDR session shall be made only by filing a “Request for Refixing/Vacation of Hearing Dates” via the Electronic Filing Service. The applicant shall obtain the consent of the other parties to the adjournment, and list the dates that are unsuitable for all parties. Sanctions for failure to make early request for adjournment, lateness or absence (25) Where any party is absent without a valid reason for the CDR session, the Court may exercise its powers under Order 34A Rule 6 of the Rules of Court to “dismiss such action or proceedings or strike out the defence or counterclaim or enter judgment or make such order as it thinks fit”. (26) Where any party is late for the CDR session, this conduct may be taken into account by the Court when making subsequent costs orders pursuant to Order 59 Rule 5(1)(c) of the Rules of Court, which states — “The Court in exercising its discretion as to costs shall, to such extent, if any, as may be appropriate in the circumstances, take into account the parties’ conduct in relation to any attempt at resolving the cause or matter by mediation or any other means of dispute resolution.”"

Case management conference for cases subject to the simplified process in Order 108 of the Rules of Court (2) All cases commenced by writ on or after 1 November 2014 in a Magistrate’s Court and any case commenced by writ on or after 1 November 2014 in a District Court (where parties have filed their consent in Form 233 of Appendix A of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5) for Order 108 to apply) are subject to the simplified process set out under Order 108 of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5). The Court will convene a case management conference within 50 days of the filing of the Defence pursuant to Order 108, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court. Practice Direction 20 (Case management conference (CMC)) sets out the procedure for the case management conference. (3) At the case management conference, the Court may refer the case for the Court Dispute Resolution (CDR) process or any other appropriate Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process, where — (a) the parties consent to such referral; or (b) where the Court is of the view that doing so would facilitate the resolution of the dispute between the parties. (4) To facilitate the Court’s decision as to the most appropriate CDR or ADR process for the case, all the parties and their solicitors must read and complete the CDR/ADR Form (Form 7 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions) prior to the case management conference. The CDR/ADR Form must be filed through the Electronic Filing Service not less than 7 working days before the Case Management Conference under the document name “CDR/ADR Form”. No court fees will be charged for the filing of the CDR/ADR Form. Pre-trial conference and summons for directions for cases not subject to the simplified process (5) Paragraphs (6) to (12) below apply to all cases that — (a) are commenced either in a Magistrate’s Court before 1 November 2014 or in a District Court on or after 1 April 2014; (b) are not subject to the simplified process under Order 108 of the Rules of Court; and (c) do not fall within any of the following class of cases: (i) non-injury motor accident (NIMA) claims; (ii) personal injury claims; (iii) medical negligence claims; and (iv) claims in negligence, including professional negligence claims that are filed in the District Court.

(7) Parties may file an SFD application prior to the PTC and file a request to vacate the PTC. Practice Direction 26 (Summonses for Directions) applies accordingly. (8) The solicitors for all the parties shall be present at the PTC. The parties need not attend the PTC. (9) The Judge hearing the PTC will give the necessary directions to facilitate the management of the case. The Judge may also recommend the most appropriate CDR or ADR process. To facilitate a considered decision on the appropriate CDR or ADR process, the parties and their solicitors must read and complete the CDR/ADR Form (Form 7 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions) prior to the PTC. A party who is not represented shall also complete the relevant sections of the CDR/ADR Form.

Any party who wishes to opt out should indicate his/her decision in the CDR/ADR Form or inform the PTC Judge of his/her wish to do so. (12) Where the Judge is of the view that the CDR or ADR process is suitable, and the party/parties have opted out of the CDR or ADR process for reasons deemed to be unsatisfactory, this conduct may be taken into account by the Court when making subsequent costs orders pursuant to Order 59 Rule 5(1)(c) of the Rules of Court, which states: “The Court in exercising its discretion as to costs shall, to such extent, if any, as may be appropriate in the circumstances, take into account the parties’ conduct in relation to any attempt at resolving the cause or matter by mediation or any other means of dispute resolution.”"

Claims in Negligence (Excluding Medical Negligence, Personal Injury and Non-Injury Motor Accident (NIMA) Claims) (1) This Practice Direction applies to all claims in negligence filed on or after 1 July 2019, including professional negligence claims (but excluding medical negligence, personal injury and NIMA claims) (“claims in negligence”). Using the Court Dispute Resolution process for all claims in negligence A. Cases that are subject to the simplified process under Order 108 of the Rules of Court (2) For all negligence claims that are — (a) filed in a Magistrate’s Court on or after 1 November 2014; or (b) filed in a District Court on or after 1 November 2014 and in respect of which the parties thereto have consented to the application of the simplified process under Order 108 of the Rules of Court, the Court will, pursuant to Order 108 Rule 3 of the Rules of Court and within 50 days of the filing of the Defence, convene the first case management conference (CMC) under Order 34A of the Rules of Court. (3) At the first CMC, the Court may make an order to direct that a case be referred for resolution through the Court Dispute Resolution (CDR) process if the Court is of the view that doing so would facilitate the resolution of the dispute between the parties. B. Cases that are not subject to the simplified process (4) For all claims in negligence, the Court will convene the first Court Dispute Resolution (CDR) session under Order 34A of the Rules of Court within 8 weeks of the filing of the Memorandum of Appearance. Notification from the Court (5) Solicitors in all claims in negligence will receive a notice from the Court fixing the date of the first CMC or CDR session, as the case may be. Only solicitors are required to attend the first CMC or CDR session unless the party in question is acting in person. The Judge may, however, direct the attendance of the parties at subsequent sessions. Case Management Process A. Court Dispute Resolution process to achieve amicable resolution of the case (6) The CMC and CDR sessions will be conducted by the State Courts’ Court Dispute Resolution Cluster (CDRC). Where the CDR process is to be used in a case to which the simplified process under Order 108 of the Rules of Court applies, the session(s) will be referred to as “CDR session(s)” in this Practice Direction. (7) The Judge hearing the CMC or CDR session will manage the case to achieve an early, cost effective and amicable resolution of the case. This may include giving the necessary directions for upfront discovery or further discovery and/or upfront exchange of affidavits of evidence-in-chief, as required by the circumstances of the case. For instance, the Judge may direct an exchange of the parties’ affidavits of evidence-in-chief early in the proceedings for the purpose of a closer examination on the issue of liability, or to facilitate in negotiating a settlement. (8) At the first or subsequent CMC or CDR session, the Judge may recommend the use of neutral evaluation, mediation or conciliation, as appropriate, to facilitate the amicable resolution of the case, having regard to factors such as the nature of the case, the factual matrix and the preference of the parties. (9) Where the appropriate dispute resolution mechanisms to be utilised in the particular case has been determined, the Judge shall give directions to convene a special CDR session to conduct the neutral evaluation, mediation or conciliation, as the case may be. Parties shall comply with the requirements set out in these Practice Directions for the relevant process. Practice Directions 41, 41A and 42 shall apply to cases proceeding for mediation, conciliation and neutral evaluation, respectively. (10) All parties should use their best endeavours to reach an amicable resolution of the case. Where parties are unable to resolve the case through a settlement agreement or a consent judgment, they should endeavour to set out their areas of agreement, and identify and narrow the issues with a view to saving time and costs at the trial. B. Directions for the expeditious disposal of the case (11) In addition to managing the case through the CDR process, the Judge may, at a CMC or CDR session, give such directions as he thinks fit in order to ensure that the case progresses expeditiously, including directions for — (a) the filing and service of lists of documents and affidavits verifying such lists; (b) the inspection of documents; (c) the exchange and filing of affidavits of evidence-in-chief; (d) the appointment of a single joint expert in cases to which Order 108 of the Rules of Court applies; and (e) the setting down of the case for trial. (12) The Judge may also fix timelines to manage and control the progress of the case and take such other action or making such other directions as he thinks appropriate in the circumstances, including costs sanctions or unless orders. C. Appointment of single joint expert (13) For cases to which Order 108 of the Rules of Court applies, where any question requiring the evidence of an expert witness arises and parties are unable to agree on the expert to be appointed, the Judge may, having regard to the provisions in Order 108 Rule 5(3) of the Rules of Court, appoint the expert for the parties as part of the case management process. Each party is expected to furnish the following for the determination of the single joint expert for the case: (a) names and curriculum vitae of two experts the party considers suitable to appoint (for which purpose a party may nominate the expert who has conducted an inspection or survey for him); (b) a quotation from each nominated expert of the fees he expects to charge for preparing the report and for giving evidence in Court; and (c) the estimated time needed to prepare the report. (14) The Judge will appoint the single joint expert after hearing submissions on the suitability or unsuitability of the nominated experts to be appointed."

(5) The solicitor who has primary conduct over the case shall be present throughout the mediation. (6) In the case of corporations and other entities, the representative who has the authority to settle shall attend the mediation.  In the event that only a board or body has authority to settle on behalf of the entity, the entity shall send the person who is the most knowledgeable about the case and who is able to recommend a settlement to the representative’s board or body. Mediators (7) Mediation will be conducted by either a Judge or an Associate Mediator of the CDRC. Associate Mediators are volunteer mediators who have been accredited by both the State Courts and the Singapore Mediation Centre. The parties will be notified by letter if their case is to be mediated by an Associate Mediator. Procedure at Mediation (8) Information on the mediation process is set out at the Singapore Courts website at https://www.judiciary.gov.sg. Unlike a trial, the primary aim of mediation is not to determine who is at fault in the dispute. The mediator’s role is to assist the parties in negotiating and agreeing on a possible settlement to their dispute. The parties will attend the mediation with their solicitors, and have the opportunity to communicate with each other as well as the mediator. (9) The procedure for mediation is more informal than a trial. The mediator will exercise his or her discretion in structuring the mediation, with a view to guiding the parties in arriving at a joint solution."

(7) Conciliation will be conducted by a Judge of the CDRC. Procedure at Conciliation (8) Information on the conciliation process is set out at the Singapore Courts website at https://www.judiciary.gov.sg. Unlike a trial, the primary aim of conciliation is not to determine who is at fault in the dispute. The role of the judge during conciliation is to assist the parties in negotiating and agreeing on a possible settlement to their dispute, with the judge playing an active role in suggesting optimal solution for the parties. Parties who are legally represented will attend the conciliation with their solicitors, and have the opportunity to communicate with each other as well as the judge. (9) The procedure for conciliation is more informal than a trial. The judge will exercise his/her discretion in structuring the conciliation, with a view to guiding the parties in arriving at a joint solution."

"text": "42. Neutral Evaluation (1) A brief form of Neutral Evaluation is used as a matter of practice in all motor accident and personal injury claims. The procedure for such CDR sessions is set out above in Practice Directions 37 (Non-injury Motor Accident (NIMA) Claims) and 38 (Personal Injury Claims), and Appendix B to these Practice Directions. (2) The procedure in this Practice Direction applies only to civil cases other than  motor accident cases or personal injury cases where parties have requested for Neutral Evaluation. Procedure in Neutral Evaluation (3) Information on the Neutral Evaluation process is set out at the Singapore Courts website at https://www.judiciary.gov.sg. Neutral Evaluation involves the parties and their solicitors making presentations of their claims and defences, including the available evidence, followed by the Judge of the State Courts’ Court Dispute Resolution Cluster (CDRC) giving an assessment of the merits of the case. This process is also useful for helping parties to arrive at areas of agreement and to discuss methods of case management to save costs and time. The details of the structure and ambit of this process may be agreed between the parties at the preliminary conference referred to in paragraph (4). Preliminary conference with solicitors (4) When parties request a Neutral Evaluation, the Court will convene a preliminary conference with the solicitors alone to discuss and agree on several options regarding the process before the date for Neutral Evaluation is fixed, i.e. — (a) whether the Neutral Evaluation is to be binding or non-binding; (b) whether the witnesses are to attend and be assessed by the court; and (c) whether affidavits of evidence-in-chief of witnesses are to be filed and used for the neutral evaluation, without witnesses’ attendance. (5) If the option referred to in paragraph (4)(b) above is chosen, the Judge may use the “witness conferencing” approach to adduce expert evidence. Witness Conferencing involves the concurrent hearing of all expert witnesses in the presence of one another. Each party’s expert witness would be afforded the opportunity to question, clarify or probe any contending views proffered by the other expert. Opening Statements (6) Each party must submit to the CDRC, and serve on all other parties, a written opening statement not less than 2 working days before the date of the Neutral Evaluation. The opening statement shall be submitted by email to SC_CDR@judiciary.gov.sg and not filed via the Electronic Filing Service. (7) The opening statement shall be in the format prescribed in Form 9K in Appendix A to these Practice Directions. A soft copy of this Form may be downloaded at https://www.judiciary.gov.sg. (8) The opening statement shall be concise and not exceed 10 pages. Attendance at Neutral Evaluation (9) All parties shall attend the Neutral Evaluation session in person unless the Court dispenses with their attendance. (10) The solicitor who has primary conduct over the case shall be present throughout the Neutral Evaluation session. (11) In the case of corporations and other entities, the representative who has authority to settle shall attend the Neutral Evaluation session.  In the event that only a board or body has authority to settle on behalf of the entity, the entity should send the person who is the most knowledgeable about the case and who is able to recommend a settlement to the representative’s board or body."

"text": "43. Introduction (1) This Part provides an opt-in framework for requests and applications for the giving of discovery and inspection of electronically stored documents, and the supply of electronic copies of such documents. A party that seeks to rely on this Part must cite the relevant Practice Direction(s) in any request or application made hereunder. Location of electronically stored documents (2) Electronically stored documents may reside in storage management systems, folders or directories in storage locations, electronic media or recording devices, including folders or directories where temporarily deleted files are located (for example, the Recycle Bin folder or Trash folder). Electronically stored documents or parts thereof may also reside in the unallocated file space or file slack on an electronic medium or recording device as deleted files or file fragments which may be recovered through the use of computer forensic tools or techniques. Definition of metadata information (3) Metadata information refers to the non-visible and not readily apparent information embedded in or associated with electronically stored documents and may include both application metadata, which is created by the application software used to create the electronic documents, and system metadata, which is created by the operating or storage system. Examples of application metadata include hidden columns or text, formatting and display codes, formulae, prior edits and editorial comments; examples of system metadata include data relating to creation, modification and access of the electronic document, its size, file format and storage location, and other document profile information like title, author, subject and keywords or tags. Metadata information may be stored internally within the electronically stored document or externally in a separate file or database. Externally stored metadata information shall be discoverable as separate documents."

Time to consider electronic discovery issues during general discovery (1) Parties are encouraged to collaborate in good faith and agree on issues relating to the discovery and inspection of electronically stored documents within the framework for discovery set forth in Order 24 of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5). Such issues may include the scope and/or any limits on documents to be given in discovery, whether parties are prepared to make voluntary disclosures, and the giving of discovery in stages according to an agreed schedule, as well as the format and manner in which copies of discoverable documents shall be supplied. (2) Parties may, immediately after the close of pleadings, but within the time prescribed in Order 25, Rule 8(1)(a) of the Rules of Court, agree on an electronic discovery protocol which may take the form set forth in Part 1 of Appendix I to these Practice Directions. Parties may include the agreed electronic discovery protocol in the summons for directions. The Court shall consider the adequacy of the agreed electronic discovery protocol and may make such order or give such direction as it thinks fit, for the just, expeditious and economical disposal of the cause or matter. The agreed electronic discovery protocol, as amended by such order or direction of the Court as the case may be, shall form part of the order under the summons for directions to be extracted for the action. (3) If parties are unable to agree on an electronic discovery protocol, the party seeking discovery of electronically stored documents may apply for an order. The application must include a draft electronic discovery protocol and must be supported by affidavit providing an account of the parties’ attempts to collaborate in good faith to reach agreement on an electronic discovery protocol."

Requests and applications for the giving of discovery Requests for discovery (1) A request for discovery of any electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents may be made before the commencement of proceedings, or at any time to any party to a cause or matter, or any person who is not a party to the proceedings. Unless the request specifies that discovery of externally stored metadata information of the requested electronically stored documents is required, the party providing discovery shall not be required to discover externally stored metadata information. (2) A class of electronically stored documents may be described by specifying or describing a search term or phrase to be used in a reasonable search for electronically stored documents. A request for the giving of discovery by reasonable search must specify or describe limits on the scope of the search; such limits shall include at least the following: (a) specifying or describing physical or logical storage locations, media or devices; and (b) specifying the period during which the requested electronically stored documents were created, received or modified. (3) A request shall not be made for the discovery of deleted files or file fragments containing information which may be recovered through the use of computer forensic tools or techniques unless: (a) a request is made for the discovery of the electronic medium or recording device on which a forensic inspection is to be conducted; and (b) a request is made for inspection of the said electronic medium or recording device in compliance with Practice Direction 48 (Inspection of electronically stored documents). Applications for discovery (4) An application for discovery of any electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents which includes externally stored metadata information must be supported by an affidavit showing that a request for externally stored metadata information of the requested electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents had been made previously. (5) An application for discovery of any electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents which specifies or describes a search term or phrase to be used in a reasonable search for electronically stored documents must specify or describe limits on the scope of the search to be conducted. (6) An application for the discovery of a computer database, electronic medium or recording device may be made together with an application for inspection of the said computer database, electronic medium or recording device in accordance with Practice Direction 48 (Inspection of electronically stored documents). (7) Upon the hearing of an application for an order for discovery of electronically stored documents, the Court shall have regard to the matters set forth in Practice Direction 46 (Matters to which regard shall be had in determining whether discovery or inspection is necessary). (8) Nothing in this Practice Direction shall prevent the party giving discovery from reviewing the discoverable electronically stored documents or the results of any reasonable search for the purpose of identifying privileged documents. However, such review for the purpose of identifying privileged documents shall not extend to the deletion, removal or alteration of metadata information."

"text": "55. Swearing or affirming of affidavits, statutory declarations and oaths (1) Rule 8 of the Commissioners for Oaths Rules (Cap. 322, Rule 3) was amended effective 1 September 1998 to permit an advocate and solicitor who is appointed a commissioner for oaths to take affidavits or statutory declarations, or administer oaths to a deponent in a language or dialect, other than English, spoken or understood by the deponent and in which the advocate and solicitor is proficient in. Given these amendments, advocates and solicitors are requested to encourage their clients to use the services of other advocates and solicitors who are appointed commissioners for oaths and who are proficient in the language or dialect in which the affidavits or statutory declarations are to be sworn or affirmed, or in which the oaths are to be taken. The State Courts’ commissioners for oaths will continue to take affidavits or statutory declarations and administer oaths for legally aided cases and for parties who are acting in person who need to file documents in the State Courts. (2) If arrangements for the use of the services of advocates and solicitors who are appointed as commissioners for oaths are not possible, deponents who are blind or illiterate in English may continue to be brought by solicitors to the State Courts’ commissioners for oaths to swear or affirm affidavits and statutory declarations.  As the State Courts’ commissioners for oaths are under a duty to ensure that the deponent understands the document being deposed to, they are obliged to interpret the document to intended deponents; this is also the case in relation to blind deponents.  This necessary exercise may take a considerable time and may cause long delays for other persons who wish to take affidavits or statutory declarations before the State Courts’ commissioners for oaths. (3) Accordingly, solicitors who wish to bring illiterate or blind deponents before the State Courts’ commissioners for oaths should first estimate the time that will be taken to interpret the document or documents to be deposed to.  If it is estimated that the total time required for interpretation of the documents will be more than 20 minutes, the solicitor must write to the Registrar and arrange for a special appointment for the documents to be sworn or affirmed; the solicitor should not bring the deponent before the duty commissioner for oaths without such an appointment. (4) If an illiterate or a blind deponent is brought before the duty State Courts commissioner for oaths and the interpretation of the document or documents takes more than 20 minutes, the commissioner for oaths will refer the solicitor and the deponent to the Registrar for a special appointment to be made for the documents to be deposed to. (5) Save in exceptional circumstances, the State Courts will not entertain requests from advocates and solicitors for its commissioners for oaths to swear or affirm affidavits or statutory declarations or administer oaths to a deponent outside the State Courts’ premises.  Advocates and solicitors appointed as commissioners for oaths and who are proficient in the language or dialect in which the affidavits or statutory declarations are to be sworn or affirmed, or in which oaths are to be taken, are instead encouraged to perform this function."

"text": "60A. Utilisation of the Concurrent Expert Evidence Procedure (1) Parties to the following civil trials and assessment of damages (“AD”) hearings in which separate expert witnesses will be appointed by the parties, should consider using the Concurrent Expert Evidence Procedure (the “CEE procedure”) under Order 40A, Rule 6 of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R5) in accordance with the provisions of this Practice Direction. The aforementioned civil trials and AD hearings are: (a) all District Court cases; (b) all Magistrate Court cases commenced before 1st November 2014, and to which Order 108 of the Rules of Court does not apply; and (c) all Magistrate Court cases commenced on or after 1st November 2014 in which appointment of separate expert witnesses by the parties are permitted under Order 108 of the Rules of Court. (2) Adoption of the CEE procedure is by consent of the parties. Factors to consider when assessing the suitability of the CEE procedure (3) When considering whether or not to utilise the CEE procedure, parties should consider the following factors: (a) the number, nature and complexity of the issues which are or will be the subject of expert evidence (“expert issues”); (b) the importance of the expert issues to the case as a whole; (c) the number of experts, their areas of expertise and their respective levels of expertise; and (d) the extent to which the use of the CEE procedure is likely to — (i) assist in clarifying or understanding the expert issues; and/or (ii) save time and/or costs at the hearing. Stage of proceedings when CEE should be considered (4) Counsel should consider the suitability of the CEE procedure once a decision has been made to appoint separate experts for the trial or AD hearing. (5) Counsel should, in any case, have obtained their client’s instructions on whether the CEE procedure would be adopted prior to attending — (a) in the case of civil trials, the first pre-trial conference after set down; or (b) in the case of AD hearings, the Assessment of Damages Court Dispute Resolution Conference (“ADCDR”) or the Pre-Assessment of Damages Conference (“PADC”) or Assessment of Damages pre-trial conference (“AD-PTC”), as applicable, after the Notice of Appointment for Assessment of Damages is filed. (Note: the above conferences will be referred to as “PTCs”, and the respective presiding judges as “PTC Judges”.) (6) In cases where an ADCDR is held, the customary quantum indication to facilitate settlement discussions will continue to be given. Upon it being clear that parties are unable to settle and that an AD hearing will have to be scheduled, the PTC Judge and the parties will then discuss the suitability of the CEE procedure. (7) In every case, the CEE procedure will only be ordered by the PTC Judge if — (a) all parties consent to the adoption of the CEE procedure; and (b) the PTC Judge considers the case to be suitable for adopting the CEE procedure. Procedures at Civil Trials where parties agree to use the CEE procedure (8) The PTC Judge will fix a date (half a day, generally) for counsel to attend a Special Confirmatory PTC before an assigned trial judge (the “Trial Judge”). (9) Counsel shall submit to the Trial Judge, in hard copy, a bundle containing the affidavits of all factual and expert witnesses that will be called at the trial (including medical reports, where relevant) no later than one week before the date of the initial Special Confirmatory PTC. (10) At the initial Special Confirmatory PTC, the Trial Judge will discuss the following matters with counsel: (a) the list of expert issues as contained in the expert witnesses’ affidavits and/or reports on which the experts disagree (the “List of Disputed Expert Issues”); (b) the extent to which the List of Disputed Expert Issues may be narrowed; (c) any further issues which the experts ought to address; and (d) the form which the Joint Expert Report should take, so as to ensure the efficient conduct of the CEE session. (11) At the end of the initial Special Confirmatory PTC, the Trial Judge may make one or more of the following directions: (a) that the experts are to discuss the List of Disputed Expert Issues so as to attempt to narrow the issues in dispute (and for this purpose, the experts’ discussion may take place via face-to-face meetings, video or teleconference, or by such other means as may be expedient); (b) that the experts are to file in court a joint expert report which should substantially be in Form 12A in Appendix A of these Practice Directions, or in such other form as may be allowed by the Trial Judge in the interest of expediency (the “Joint Expert Report”), after the experts’ discussion, and in any case the Joint Expert Report should list out the expert issues that have been agreed, those that have not been agreed, and the reasons for the areas of disagreement; (c) that the Joint Expert Report is to be filed in court no later than 4 weeks after the date of the initial Special Confirmatory PTC; and (d) that a second Special Confirmatory PTC is to be scheduled on or around 4 weeks after the date of the initial Special Confirmatory PTC. (12) At the second Special Confirmatory PTC, Counsel shall report to the Trial Judge on the status of the preparation of the Joint Expert Report. The Trial Judge will then make one of the following orders: (a) if the Joint Expert Report is ready, the Trial Judge will — (i) discuss with the parties the sequence in which disputed expert issues will be dealt with at the CEE session; and (ii) assign trial dates; and (b) if the Joint Expert Report is not ready, the Trial Judge may adjourn the case for a further Special Confirmatory PTC. Procedures in AD Hearings where parties agree to the CEE procedure (13) For AD hearings, at the ADCDR, AD-PTC or PADC, the Court will, on a case by case basis, make one or more of the following directions, as appropriate: (a) that counsel, the parties or the experts are to compile and file Annex 1 (List of Agreed Expert Issues) and/or Annex 2 (List of Disputed Expert Issues) of the Joint Expert Report based on the parties’ respective expert’s report(s) prior to the date of the AD hearing; (b) that the experts are to discuss the List of Disputed Expert Issues so as to attempt to narrow the issues in dispute (for which purpose the experts’ discussion may take place via face-to-face meetings, video or teleconference, or by such other means as may be expedient); (c) that the experts are to file a Joint Expert Report after a joint experts’ discussion prior to the date of the AD hearing, which Joint Expert Report should list out the expert issues that have been agreed, those that have not been agreed, and the reasons for the areas of disagreement; or (d) any other directions as will ensure a cost effective and expedient conduct of the AD hearing. (14) The Deputy Registrar hearing the AD may, on a case by case basis, where appropriate, schedule a Special Confirmatory PTC with parties prior to the date of the AD hearing. Court’s Discretion to modify the CEE procedures (15) Where the circumstances of any individual case warrant, the PTC Judge and/or the Trial Judge may, upon discussion with the parties, modify, simplify and/or dispense with any of the above procedures, so as to ensure that the costs of utilising the CEE procedure would not be disproportionate to the claim(s) in dispute. CEE procedure at Trial or AD hearing (16) The CEE procedure, including the sequence of witnesses, may be determined by the Judge hearing the Trial or AD hearing on a case by case basis. Generally, the factual witnesses will complete their evidence before the experts are asked to give their evidence concurrently. (17) During the CEE session, the experts will be sworn in together. The disputed expert issues will be dealt with one issue at a time. Each expert will be asked to state his opinion in turn on a disputed expert issue. Each expert will then be asked to comment on the other expert’s opinion. Counsel will then be given a chance to cross-examine the other party’s expert on his opinion on the disputed expert issue, followed by a re-examination by the expert’s client’s counsel. The Judge may also ask questions of either expert at any time. At the end of each segment, each expert is to make concluding remarks on the disputed expert issue. The process will then be repeated for the next disputed expert issue until all disputed expert issues have been covered. (18) The provisions of this Practice Direction and Form 12A shall apply, with the necessary modifications, to suitable third party and other similar proceedings."

"text": "68. Adjournment or vacation of hearing dates and part-heard cases (1) Where dates have been fixed for the trial of any cause or matter, any request for an adjournment or vacation of the trial dates shall be made to a Judge or Registrar by way of summons with a supporting affidavit even in those cases where counsel for the other party or parties consent to the adjournment. (2) Subject to any directions of the Judge or Registrar, when a case is adjourned, the Registrar will assign such days as are available for the hearing of the case, and counsel will be expected to take the dates at short notice.  Where counsel is unable for any reason to take the dates, he shall apply to the Judge or Registrar for an adjournment in accordance with paragraph (1) above. (3) In the event that the hearing of a case is not concluded within the number of days allotted, the Court may direct the hearing of the case to continue beyond the allotted time rather than adjourning the case part-heard to another date.  Counsel for parties in all cases should therefore be prepared to continue with the hearing of the matter notwithstanding the fact that the time originally allotted may have expired.  Subject to any such directions of the Court, all part-heard cases shall be fixed for continued hearing at short notice.  Applications for adjournment of such hearing dates may be granted only for good and sufficient reasons."

"text": "70. Bundle of documents filed on setting down (1) Order 34, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5) requires a bundle containing certain documents to be filed together with the notice for setting down. The documents in the bundle should be included in the order in which these appear in Order 34, Rule 3 (1). Documents filed electronically (2) For proceedings which have been commenced using the Electronic Filing Service, rather than preparing these documents in paper form and binding them, the documents must be prepared in an electronic format. (3) In addition, parties should endeavour to file a core bundle of documents rather than the numerous bundles that are often filed. This core bundle should comprise only documents that are relevant to the hearing in question, or which will be referred to in the course of the hearing.   (4) If there are other documents, the relevance of which is uncertain, these documents should be brought to the hearing in paper form. Such other documents should only be filed electronically as and when directed by the Court. (5) The following directions shall apply to all bundles and opening statements: (a) Index pages must be prepared. (b) Bookmarks should be created in a Portable Document Format (PDF) file for each such reference in the index. There should be as many book-marks in that PDF file as there are references in the index to documents in that PDF file. (c) The name given to each bookmark should be the same as the corresponding reference in the index. (d) If a bundle of documents includes more than one PDF document, the various PDF documents should be arranged chronologically or in some logical order. (6) For proceedings using the Electronic Filing Service, a bundle of documents may be created online and filed through the Electronic Filing Service. The electronic bundle must be created in Portable Document Format (PDF). The electronic bundle may contain the following: (a) documents in the electronic case file; and (b) documents that have been uploaded into the electronic case file by solicitors or other persons given access to the shared folder in the electronic case file. Documents not filed electronically (7) For proceedings which were not commenced using the Electronic Filing Service, the setting down bundle should be firmly secured together with plastic ring binding or plastic spine thermal binding.  The rings or spines should be red for plaintiffs and blue for defendants, and should have a transparent plastic cover in front and at the back. (8) Every page of the setting down bundle should be paginated consecutively at the top right hand corner of each page from the first page until the last.  In the event that the bundle is in several volumes, the pagination should nonetheless run consecutively from the first page of the first volume until the last page of the last volume."

"text": "71. Documents for use in trials in open Court (1) This Practice Direction shall apply to trials in open Court of — (a) writ actions; and (b) originating summonses ordered to be continued as if the cause of action had been begun by writ. (2) Order 34, Rule 3A of the Rules of Court requires the originals of the affidavits of the evidence-in-chief of all witnesses and a bundle of documents to be filed not less than 5 working days before the trial of an action.  In addition, to improve the conduct of civil proceedings and to reduce the time taken in the presentation of cases in Court, the following documents shall also be prepared by the respective solicitors of the parties: (a) a bundle of authorities; and (b) an opening statement. Documents which need not be filed electronically (3) The provisions of Practice Directions 69 (Electronic filing of documents and authorities for use in court) and 70(2) to (6) (Bundles of documents filed on setting down) do not apply to (i) the bundle of affidavits of evidence-in-chief if the individual affidavits have already been e-filed; and (ii) the bundles of documents that are filed in Court pursuant to the provisions of Order 34, Rule 3A(1)(b) of the Rules of the Court. Such documents may be tendered to the Registry in hardcopy together with an electronic copy stored on a CD-ROM in Portable Document Format (PDF) and complying with the provisions of this Practice Direction. (4) The electronic copy must tally in all respects with the hardcopy, as it will be uploaded into the case file by the Registry staff and will form part of the electronic case file. The importance of not submitting unnecessarily large electronic files is emphasised. To this end, parties are to adhere as far as possible to the guidelines set out on the Electronic Filing Service website (currently at www.elitigation.sg), or its equivalent as may be set up from time to time, on the resolution to be used when scanning documents into Portable Document Format (PDF). (5) In the event that parties elect to electronically file such documents, they must nevertheless tender a bundle of these documents to the Registry in hard copy. It shall not be necessary to pay any additional court fees in respect of the hard copy in such circumstances. Bundle of documents (6) The bundle of documents required to be filed by Order 34, Rule 3A of the Rules of Court should be paginated consecutively throughout at the top right hand corner and may be printed on one side or both sides of each page. (a) An index of contents of each bundle in the manner and form set out in Form 13 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions must also be furnished.  No bundle of documents is necessary in cases where parties are not relying on any document at the trial. (b) Under Order 34, Rule 3A (3) of the Rules of Court it is the responsibility of solicitors for all parties to agree and prepare an agreed bundle as soon as possible.  The scope to which the agreement extends must be stated in the index sheet of the agreed bundle. (c) Hard copies of the documents in the bundles should — (i) be firmly secured together with plastic ring binding or plastic spine thermal binding, and such rings or spines should be red for plaintiffs and blue for defendants with a transparent plastic cover in front and at the back; (ii) have flags to mark out documents to which repeated references will be made in the course of hearing, and such flags shall — (A) bear the appropriate indicium by which the document is indicated in the index of contents; and (B) be spaced out evenly along the right side of the bundle so that as far as possible they do not overlap one another; and (iii) be legible (for which purpose clear legible photo-copies of original documents may be exhibited instead of the originals provided the originals are made available for inspection by the other parties before the hearing and by the Judge at the hearing). (d) Where originals and copies of documents are included in one bundle, it should be stated in the index which documents are originals and which are copies. (e) Only documents which are relevant or necessary for the trial shall be included in the bundles.  In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs have been wasted by the inclusion of unnecessary documents, the Court will have no hesitation in making a special order for costs against the relevant person. (f) A core bundle should (unless clearly unnecessary) also be provided containing the most important documents upon which the case will turn or to which repeated reference will have to be made. The documents in this bundle should normally be paginated but should also be cross-referenced to copies of the documents included in the main bundles.  The bundle supplied to the Court should be contained in a loose-leaf file which can easily have further documents added to it if required. Bundle of authorities (7) Hard copies of the bundle of authorities to be prepared by each party should: (a) contain all the authorities, cases, statutes, subsidiary legislation and any other materials relied on; (b) be properly bound with plastic ring binding or plastic spine thermal binding in accordance with the requirements set out in paragraph (6)(c) above; (c) be paginated consecutively at the top right hand corner of each page (for which purpose the pagination should commence on the first page of the first bundle and run sequentially to the last page of the last bundle); and (d) contain an index of the authorities in that bundle and be appropriately flagged for easy reference. (8) Only authorities which are relevant or necessary for the trial shall be included in the bundles.  No bundle of authorities is necessary in cases where parties are not relying on any authority at the trial.  In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs have been wasted by the inclusion of unnecessary authorities, the Court will have no hesitation in making a special order for costs against the relevant person. (9) The bundle of authorities shall be filed and served on all relevant parties at least 3 working days before trial. Opening statements (10) A proper opening statement is of great assistance to the Court as it sets out the case in a nutshell, both as to facts and law.  It enables the Judge to appreciate what the case is about, and what he is to look out for when reading and listening to the evidence that will follow. Opening statements also help to clarify issues between the parties, so that unnecessary time is not spent on trying to prove what is not disputed or irrelevant. (a) In the light of these objectives, opening statements will be required in all cases from all parties, except where dispensation has been granted by the trial Judge and in running down actions.  Statements submitted may be taken as read by the trial Judge. (b) The plaintiff’s statement as provided for in sub-paragraph (d) below, should, unless exempted or dispensation has been granted by the trial Judge, be filed and served on all other relevant parties not less than 3 working days before the commencement of the trial for which they are to be used. (c)  The other counsel should each similarly not later than 2 working days before the start of the trial provide to the Court (with copies at the same time to their opponents) a statement which should concisely state the nature of their case on each of the issues to be tried and summarise the propositions of law to be advanced with references to the main authorities to be relied on. The character and length of this document will depend on the circumstances and whether there is any counterclaim or third party proceedings. (d) In the case of the plaintiff, the statement must include the following: (i) a summary of essential facts indicating which, if any, are agreed; (ii) an indication of how these facts are to be proved, identifying relevant witnesses and documents; (iii) a summary of the issues involved with cross-references as appropriate to the pleadings; (iv) a summary of the plaintiff’s case in relation to each of the issues with references to the key documents relied upon, and a summary of the propositions of law to be advanced with references to the main authorities to be relied on; and (v) an explanation of the reliefs claimed (if these are unusual or complicated). (e) Counsel will be at liberty to amend their statements at the trial but in such event will be expected to explain the reasons for the amendments. Timeline for tendering documents (11) At the trial of the cause or matter, an adjournment may be ordered if: (a) the above documents or any of them, save for the opening statement in cases where it is not required or dispensation was granted, were not filed and served within the prescribed time or at all; or (b) one party seeks to tender any of the above documents or supplements thereto except for supplements to the opening statement at the trial of the cause or matter. (12) If an adjournment is ordered for any of the reasons set out in paragraph (11) above, the party who has failed to file or serve his documents within the prescribed time or at all or who seeks to tender a document or supplement thereto except for supplements to the opening statement may be ordered by the Court to bear the costs of the adjournment."

"text": "73. Citation of written judgments and secondary authorities Citation of written judgments (1) The neutral citation system (a) A neutral citation is a court-approved system of citation which is independent of the series of law reports or other publications, and unique to each written judgment. (b) Each written judgment from a particular level of court is assigned a sequential number, starting from 1 at the beginning of each calendar year. (2) Specific paragraph citations (a) Counsel will be required to make specific citations by referring to the paragraph number of the judgment, and not to the page number of the judgment or report. (b) For consistency, square brackets will be used to denote paragraph numbers. The paragraph mark (¶) will no longer be used. (3) Court designators SGDC – Singapore District Court SGMC – Singapore Magistrates’ Court SGSCT – Singapore Small Claims Tribunal (4) Application of the neutral citation system The application of the system is as follows: (a) Cases reported in the Singapore Law Reports shall be cited using their Singapore Law Reports citations, in priority to their neutral citations. (b) Unreported decisions shall be cited using their neutral citations. (5) Example and explanation ABC Co Pte Ltd v XYZ Co Ltd [2003] SGDC 25, at [3], [8]. Year of the decision - [2003] Level of Court - SGDC (Singapore District Court) Sequential Number - 25 (twenty-fifth written judgment rendered by the District Courts in 2003) Paragraph Number(s) - Paragraphs 3 and 8 of the judgment Citation of secondary authorities in court (6) Counsel are advised to be more circumspect in their use of secondary authorities such as textbooks, journals, periodicals and other treatises. As far as possible, counsel should rely on primary authorities to support the proposition of law argued for; and (7) If it necessary to cite secondary authorities, counsel should ensure that the material to be cited is directly relevant to the case before the Court. Counsel are also reminded of their duty to ensure that such material is not cited out of context. The following are specific guidelines for the citation of different types of secondary authorities: (a) Textbooks that are generally recognised as leading textbooks in the relevant area of law may be readily cited to the Court. (b) If counsel wish to cite academic articles in journals and periodicals in support of a particular proposition of law, they should ensure that they are citing a statement, rather than a critique, of the law. Citation of academic articles should be limited to those written by eminent authors of reputable standing.  The articles should also have been published in established journals and periodicals. (c) Legal opinions written by other counsel not having conduct of the case before the court should generally not be cited as authority. Such legal opinions are considerably less authoritative than academic articles, as the views expressed in these private opinions have not been subject to the rigorous scrutiny of editorship and public critique. (8) Counsel’s attention is drawn to Order 59 Rule 8 of the Rules of Court which gives the Court the power to make an order for costs personally against errant advocates and solicitors, who have wasted or incurred costs unreasonably or improperly.  The Court will not hesitate to invoke its powers under Order 59 Rule 8 of the Rules of Court in cases where costs have been wasted due to counsel’s indiscriminate citation of unnecessary and irrelevant secondary authorities."

The amount of costs claimed for work done should be divided into as many parts corresponding with the different rates of GST applicable pursuant to section 16 of the Goods and Services Tax Act, its predecessor and any subsequent amendments thereto. Each part should state the global sum of costs claimed and the applicable GST rate for the relevant period. (ii) The second section which sets out the work done for and in the taxation of costs should describe the work done, the sum of costs claimed and the applicable GST rate.

Pre-action protocols for defamation actions (1) Compliance with pre-action protocol (a) Claimants in defamation actions must comply with the pre-action protocol set out in Appendix K before commencing Court proceedings. All parties are required to comply in substance and spirit with the terms of the protocol. A breach by one party will not exempt the other parties in the action from complying with the protocol so far as they are able to do so. (b) In exercising its discretion as to costs, the Court will consider whether the protocol has been complied with. If non-compliance with the protocol has led to unnecessary costs, the Court may make the following orders: (i) an order disallowing a defaulting party his costs, or some part of his costs, even if he succeeds in the action; (ii) an order that the defaulting party pay the other party or parties their costs of the proceedings, or part of those costs; and (iii) an order that the defaulting party pay those costs on an indemnity basis. (c) The Court will consider whether the protocol has been complied with when exercising its discretion in determining the amount of interest payable, and may make the following orders as it thinks fit: (i) an order awarding a successful party who has complied with the protocol interest from an earlier period; and (ii) an order depriving a successful party who has not complied with the protocol interest in respect of such period as may be specified. (d) Where there are good reasons for non-compliance with the protocol, the Court will not impose any sanction against the defaulting party."

Reference to Actuarial Tables for the Assessment of Damages in Personal Injury and Death Claims (1) In all proceedings for the assessment of damages in personal injury and death claims that are heard on or after 1 April 2021, the Court will refer to the “Actuarial Tables with Explanatory Notes for use in Personal Injury and Death Claims” published by Academy Publishing of the Singapore Academy of Law (the “Actuarial Tables”) to determine an appropriate multiplier, unless the facts of the case and ends of justice dictate otherwise. This is so regardless of when the accidents or incidents that gave rise to those claims occurred, and regardless of the dates on which the actions were commenced. (2) The Actuarial Tables will serve as a guide and the selection of the appropriate multipliers and the amount of damages awarded remain at the discretion of the Court. Where appropriate on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Court may depart from the multipliers in the Actuarial Tables."
